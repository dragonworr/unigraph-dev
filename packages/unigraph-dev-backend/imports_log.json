There are a million and one apps promising to help us do anything and everything we could want. The problem is that there are too many tools to choose from, so it's difficult to find the right tool for the job. With so many apps out there promising to be the best productivity tool, it's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed. Managing daily tasks to managing projects has become difficult and adds to stress.</span></p><p id=\"viewer-4rjss\"><span>In this post, I have shared my favorite application that'll help you to finally say goodbye to your never-ending to-do list. and get more organized in life.</span></p><h2 id=\"viewer-734dv\"><span>What is WorkFlowy?</span></h2><p id=\"viewer-8i9nk\"><span>WorkFlowy is a web-based outliner and productivity software that helps you manage your projects and tasks. It features a drag and drop interface with an unlimited number of hierarchical lists, which are all synced with the cloud. You can also set due dates, reminders and attach files to your entries.</span></p><p id=\"viewer-65sj3\"><span>WorkFlowy can also be used as a task management tool. It does not have the complexity and features of other task managers, but it has a user-friendly interface and the ability to create lists that contain other lists.</span></p><div data-hook=\"imageViewer\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" id=\"viewer-da5mp\"><p><span dir=\"auto\">Best outliner application for productivity </span></p></div><h2 id=\"viewer-5n1id\"><span>How to use the WorkFlowy effectively</span></h2><h3 id=\"viewer-8l22u\"><span><strong><span>1. Use the Templates Feature</span></strong></span></h3><p id=\"viewer-fldk\"><span>WorkFlowy has a feature called templates that can be used to save time. The templates are made with a specific purpose in mind and will allow you to get things done quickly. Templates can be used for any list type, from grocery lists to meetings, from project management, and email management.</span></p><p id=\"viewer-3cq7p\"><span>The templates can be set up by the user to generate any type of node (document) needed. They can be as specific as individual documents or as general as templates for different kinds of content. With templates, you don’t need to start from scratch when you need a document created, you don’t have to recreate the wheel every time. Furthermore, with WorkFlowy's template library, you don't have to worry about forgetting or losing your template; you can just look it up in the search bar.</span></p><h3 id=\"viewer-1ipsq\"><span><strong><span>2. Create a checklist for all tasks</span></strong></span></h3><p id=\"viewer-65gj5\"><span>Every day you have a set of important tasks that need to be completed. Whether it's your job or personal life, it's important to keep track of your progress. A checklist is a useful tool that can help you do this.</span></p><p id=\"viewer-c8r6q\"><span>A checklist can be simple or complicated, depending on the needs that you have. A basic list could include items such as: going to work, going grocery shopping, and doing laundry. On the other hand, more complex lists could include items like being mindful about how much time and effort is being spent on a task before starting it, taking breaks throughout the day when needed, and checking in with others periodically to see how they are doing.</span></p><p id=\"viewer-b46lv\"><span>WorkFlowy is an easy-to-use checklist creator that makes it possible for individuals to create, track, share and collaborate on checklists. Here’s an example:</span></p><ul><li id=\"viewer-d4r20\"><p>Determine your task list</p></li><li id=\"viewer-d2cqh\"><p>Put the tasks in order of priority and duration</p></li><li id=\"viewer-605m8\"><p>Figure out what needs to be done before you do other tasks</p></li><li id=\"viewer-140el\"><p>Consider what else you need to know in order to do the task\n\n</p></li></ul><h3 id=\"viewer-cqqth\"><span><strong><span>3. Break down projects into smaller tasks and sub-tasks using the indent feature</span></strong></span></h3><p id=\"viewer-dtgj\"><span>The indent feature is one of the most helpful features for breaking down projects into smaller tasks and sub-tasks. An indent feature is a helpful tool for breaking down projects into smaller tasks and sub-tasks. When you indent, it helps you stay on top of your project and organize yourself better. When you are working on a big project, it's easy to get overwhelmed. The indent feature can make the process easier by providing a hierarchy structure that allows you to visualize the completion process. Indenting can help you break down your document into logical sections and create an outline with a hierarchy structure. To indent a node, simply press the <strong><span>TAB</span></strong> key on your keyboard and to outdent <span>SHIFT + TAB</span>.</span></p><p id=\"viewer-b1g5i\"><span>Overall, it makes it easier for you to see what needs to be done, how long each task will take, and what step comes next in your project. It is also helpful for keeping track of the progress of each task.</span></p><h3 id=\"viewer-b95e4\"><span><strong><span>4. Use hashtags (#) for better organization</span></strong></span></h3><p id=\"viewer-64gu7\"><span>Tagging items allow you to keep related items together for quick reference. For example, if you tag a node with \"ToDo,\" you can easily filter all the nodes that have <a href=\"https://www.scroogemarketer.com/blog/hashtags/ToDo\" target=\"_self\"><span>#ToDo</span></a> mentioned. The tags feature can also be used to organize posts by date, topic, or the person you are sharing with. The best part is that you can organize your thoughts with tags, which let you see everything you’ve marked with that tag in one click.</span></p><p id=\"viewer-2ahvi\"><span>This makes organizing things much easier, especially when your WorkFlowy document starts to get large. Type a @ OR # before any word and then clicking on that tag will only display items containing that tag.</span></p><p id=\"viewer-46bbf\"><span>Here are some suggestions to use tags:</span></p><ul><li id=\"viewer-2pef\"><p>When will you do stuff? Use <a href=\"https://www.scroogemarketer.com/blog/hashtags/now\" target=\"_self\"><span><strong>#now</strong></span></a> for tasks you want to complete today, <a href=\"https://www.scroogemarketer.com/blog/hashtags/soon\" target=\"_self\"><span><strong>#soon</strong></span></a> for tasks you want to accomplish in the next week or so.</p></li><li id=\"viewer-7l1ao\"><p>@ tags are used to keep track of who is doing what. It becomes easier to allocate task by simply <strong>@Name</strong></p></li><li id=\"viewer-b3s2d\"><p>What is the priority? Use <a href=\"https://www.scroogemarketer.com/blog/hashtags/important\" target=\"_self\"><span><strong>#important</strong></span></a> for items that will have a big impact and <a href=\"https://www.scroogemarketer.com/blog/hashtags/urgent\" target=\"_self\"><span><strong>#urgent</strong></span></a> for items that are time-sensitive.</p></li></ul><h3 id=\"viewer-f9r32\"><span><strong><span>5. Share the node with access control.</span></strong></span></h3><p id=\"viewer-21m21\"><span>One of the most powerful features of WorkFlowy is the ability to share part of your WorkFlowy with anyone at any level of the hierarchy. The recipient can add the shared item into their WorkFlowy and make it visible to a subset of items. Any changes made are synced across your devices.</span></p><p id=\"viewer-bcktt\"><span>You can share a bullet point with others by hovering over the bullet and clicking the 'Share' option. The dialog box will open, allowing you to enter an email address for the person you are sharing it. Click ‘Add to add them to the list of shared people. You can even share with more than one person.</span></p><h3 id=\"viewer-o66u\"><span><span>Concluding thoughts on Workflowy </span></span></h3><p id=\"viewer-3g1i7\"><span>WorkFlowy is an organizational tool that is simple and easy to use. It's a tree-like structure for organizing your thoughts, ideas, tasks, and projects. You can create nested lists with bullets, checkboxes, or text. You can also assign dates and tags to items in the list. WorkFlowy also employs useful features like syncing across devices so you can access your lists wherever

LessWrong and EAF\"&nbsp;</p><p>--Kuhan Jeyapragasan, Stanford EA President</p></blockquote><p>Below are a bunch of tips, systems, and devices for improving productivity. I don't mean to claim I know a lot about productivity—I think there is likely a lot of useful advice I am missing. If you are new to thinking about productivity, a lot of this stuff might be useful, though <strong>it is probably better to instead aim for the mindset that can generate these tips</strong> and habits for yourself. For this, I recommend attending <a href=\"https://www.rationality.org/workshops/upcoming\">a Center for Applied Rationality workshop</a>, reading <a href=\"https://www.rationality.org/resources/handbook\">the CFAR handbook</a>, checking out <a href=\"https://www.neelnanda.io/\">Neel Nanda's blog</a>, and/or reading <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/rationality\">Rationality: A to Z</a> (podcast form <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rationality-from-ai-to-zombies/id1299826696\">here</a>).</p><p>My <strong>recommendations are in very rough order of how much I recommend them</strong>, based on how excited I am/would expect someone else to be to know about the tip (my top recommendation being Things 3 + Apple Watch).

that many\ncompilers have unified infrastructure for both languages.  In other words,\nyour C code is already going through codepaths shared with C++ (and likely\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/542457/\">written in C++</a>).  In fact, when trivial\nC programs are compiled as C++ with g++, identically sized binaries come\nout.  All example programs in our beloved <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language\">The C Programming\nLanguage</a> compile\nas valid C++.  Interestingly, the introduction of the 1988 edition of K&amp;R notes\nBjarne Stroustrup’s C++ “translator” was used extensively for local testing.</p>\n<p>The relation goes further - the entire C library is included in C++ ‘by\nreference’, and C++ knows how to call all C code.  And conversely, it is\nentirely possible to call C++ functions from C.</p>\n<p>C++ was explicitly designed to not present unavoidable overhead compared\nagainst C. To <a href=\"https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/big-picture#zero-overhead-principle\">quote from the ISO C++\nwebsite</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The zero-overhead principle is a guiding principle for the design of C++.\nIt states that: What you don’t use, you don’t pay for (in time or space) and\nfurther: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In other words, no feature should be added to C++ which would make any\nexisting code (not using the new feature) larger or slower, nor should any\nfeature be added for which the compiler would generate code that is not as\ngood as a programmer would create without using the feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are big claims, and they do require some proof.  For this to be true\nin 2018, we do have to be careful.  Lots of code uses exceptions, and these\ndo come with some overhead.  However, it is also possible to declare that\nall or part of our code is exception free, which leads the compiler to\nremove that infrastructure.</p>\n<p>But, here is actual proof. Sorting 100 million integers using the C\n<code>qsort()</code> function, using <code>std::sort()</code> in C++ and using the C++-2017\nparallel sort, we get the following timings:</p>\n<pre><code>C qsort(): 13.4 seconds  (13.4 CPU)\nC++ std::sort(): 8.0 seconds (8.0 CPU)\nC++ parallel sort: 1.7 seconds (11.8 seconds of CPU time)\n</code></pre><p>What is this magic? The C++ version is 40% faster than C? How is this\npossible?</p>\n<p>Here is the code:</p>\n<pre><code>int cmp(const void* a, const void* b)\n{\n  if(*(int*)a &lt; *(int*)b)\n    return -1;\n  else if(*(int*)a &gt; *(int*)b)\n    return 1;\n  else \n    return 0;  \n}\n\nint main(int argc, char**argv)\n{\n  auto lim = atoi(argv[1]);\n\n  std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec;\n  vec.reserve(lim);\n\n  while(lim--)\n    vec.push_back(random());\n\n  if(*argv[2]=='q')\n    qsort(&amp;vec[0], vec.size(), sizeof(int), cmp);\n  else if(*argv[2]=='p')\n    std::sort(std::execution::par, vec.begin(), vec.end()); \n  else if(*argv[2]=='s')\n    std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());\n}\n</code></pre><p>It is worth studying this a bit. The <code>cmp()</code> function is there for\n<code>qsort()</code>, and defines the sort order.</p>\n<p><code>Main</code> is main as in C, but then we see the first oddity: auto.\nWe’ll cover this later, but auto almost always does what you think it does:\ncalculate the required type and use it.</p>\n<p>The next two lines define a <code>vector</code> containing integers, and reserve enough\nspace in there for how many entries we want. This is an optional\noptimization. The <code>while</code> loop then fills the vector with ‘random’ numbers.</p>\n<p>Next up.. something magic happens. We call the C <code>qsort()</code> function, to\noperate on the C++ vector containing our numbers. How is this possible?\nIt turns out <code>std::vector</code> is explicitly designed to be interoperable with\nraw pointer operations. It is meant to be able to be passed to C library or\nsystem calls. It stores its data in a consecutive slab of memory that can be\nchanged at will.</p>\n<p>The next 4 lines use the C++ sorting functions. On some versions of G++, you\nmay need this (non-standard) syntax to get the same result: <code> __gnu_parallel::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end())</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-how-come-c-stdsort-is-faster-than-qsort\">So how come C++ std::sort is faster than qsort?</h2>\n<p><code>qsort()</code> is a library function that accepts a comparison callback. The\ncompiler (and its optimizer) can not look at the <code>qsort()</code> procedure as a\nwhole therefore. In addition, there is function call overhead.</p>\n<p>The C++ std::sort version meanwhile is actually a ‘template’ which is able\nto inline the comparison predicate, which for <code>int</code>s defaults to the <code>&lt;</code>\noperator.</p>\n<p>To make sure we are being fair, since <code>qsort()</code> is using a custom\ncomparator, and our <code>std::sort</code> is not, we can use:</p>\n<pre><code>std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), \n          [](const auto&amp; a, const auto&amp; b) { return a &lt; b; } \n     );\n</code></pre><p>When executed, this still takes the same amount of time. To sort in reverse\norder, we could change <code>a &lt; b</code> to <code>b &lt; a</code>. But what is this magic syntax?\nThis is a C++ lambda expression, a way to define functions inline. This can\nbe used for many things, and defining a sort operation this way is highly\nidiomatic.</p>\n<p>Finally, C++ 2017 comes with parallel versions of many core algorithms, and\nfor our case, it appears the parallel sort is indeed delivering a 4.7-fold\nspeedup on my 8 hyper-core machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"strings\">Strings</h2>\n<p>It may be hard to believe, but for much of the time of C++’s original\ndevelopment, it did not have a string class.  Writing such a class\nwas somewhat of a rite of passage, and everyone made their own.  The reason\nbehind this was partially the prolonged attempt to make a class that was\neverything for everyone.</p>\n<p>The <code>std::string</code> C++ ended up with in 1998 interoperates well with C code:</p>\n<pre><code>std::string dir(\"/etc/\"), fname;\nfname = dir + \"hosts\";\nFILE* fp = fopen(fname.c_str(), \"r\");\n</code></pre><p><a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string\">std::string</a> offers\nmost functionality you’d expect, like concatenation (as shown above).  Some\nfurther code:</p>\n<pre><code>auto pos = fname.find('/');\nif(pos != string::npos) \n\tcout &lt;&lt; \"First / is at \" &lt;&lt; pos &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n\npos = fname.find(\"host\");\nif(pos != string::npos) \n\tcout &lt;&lt; \"Found host at \" &lt;&lt; pos &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n\nstd::string newname = fname;\nnewname += \".backup\";\n\nunlink(newname.c_str());\n</code></pre><p><code>std::string</code> provides unsafe and unchecked access to its characters with\nthe [] operator, so <code>newname[0] == '/'</code>, but wise people use\n<a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/at\"><code>newname.at(0)</code></a>\nwhich performs bounds checking.</p>\n<p>The post-2011 design of std::string is pretty interesting.  The storage of\nbasic string implementation could look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>struct mystring\n{\n\tchar* data;\n\tsize_t len;\n\tsize_t capacity; // how much we've allocated already\n};\n</code></pre><p>On a modern system, this is 24 bytes of data.  The <code>capacity</code> field is used\nto store how much memory has been allocated so <code>mystring</code> knows when it\nneeds to reallocate. Not reallocating every time a character is added to a\nstring is a pretty big win.</p>\n<p>Frequently however, the things we store in strings are a lot shorter than 24\nbytes.  For this reason, modern C++ std::string implementations implement\nSmall String Optimization, which allows them to store 16 or even 21 bytes of\ncharacters within their own storage, without using <code>malloc()</code>, which is a\nspeedup.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of preventing needless calls to <code>malloc()</code> is that an array\nof strings is now stored in contiguous memory, which is great for memory\ncache hitrates, which often delivers whole factors of speedup.</p>\n<p>After years of design, <code>std::string</code> may not be everything to everyone, but\nconsistent with the ‘zero overhead’ principle, it beats what you would have\nquickly written by hand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summarising\">Summarising</h2>\n<p>In part 1 of this series, I hope to have shown you some interesting bits of\nC++ you could start using right away - gaining you a lot of new power\nwithout immediately filling your code with complicated stuff.</p>\n<p>Part 2 can be found <a href=\"https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cpp-2/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have any favorite things you’d like to see discussed or\nquestions, please hit me up on\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PowerDNS_Bert\">@PowerDNS_Bert</a> or\n<a href=\"mailto:bert.hubert@powerdns.com\">bert.hubert@powerdns.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you like this stuff, come work with me over at PowerDNS -\n<a href=\"https://www.powerdns.com/careers.html#securityDeveloper\">aspiring C++ programmers\nwelcome</a>!</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n  \n\n\n\n</article></div>"},"type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/interface/textual"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2552","_updatedAt":"2021-07-24T00:22:46.535Z"}}}},"type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/creative_work"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2553","_createdAt":"2021-07-24T00:22:45.062Z","_updatedAt":"2021-07-24T00:22:46.535Z"},"unigraph.indexes":{"name":{"uid":"_:2554"}}}},"name":{"uid":"_:2554","_value.%":"Modern C++ for C Programmers: part 1 - Bert Hubert's writings"},"url":{"uid":"_:2555","_value":{"uid":"_:2556","type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/url"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2557","_createdAt":"2021-07-24T00:22:45.062Z","_updatedAt":"2021-07-24T00:22:45.062Z"},"_value.%":"https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/c++-1/","dgraph.type":["Entity"]}}}},{"uid":"_:2225","dgraph.type":["Entity"],"unigraph.indexes":{"name":{"uid":"_:2226"}}},{"uid":"_:2558","type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/web_bookmark"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2559","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T03:18:43.958Z"},"dgraph.type":["Entity"],"_value":{"uid":"_:2560","name":{"uid":"_:2561","_value.%":"Open, Programmable, and Virtualized 5G Networks | This website is a repository that links to open source projects that contribute to the development of open, programmagle, and virtualized 5G networks."},"url":{"uid":"_:2562","_value":{"uid":"_:2563","type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/url"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2564","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T03:18:43.577Z","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T03:18:43.577Z"},"dgraph.type":["Entity"],"_value.%":"https://open5g.info/"}},"creative_work":{"uid":"_:2565","_propertyType":"inheritance","_value":{"uid":"_:2566","type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/creative_work"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2567","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T03:18:43.958Z","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T03:18:43.577Z"},"_propertyType":"inheritance","dgraph.type":["Entity"],"_value":{"uid":"_:2568","text":{"uid":"_:2569","_value":{"uid":"_:2570","dgraph.type":["Interface"],"_value":{"uid":"_:2571","_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2572","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T03:18:43.958Z"},"dgraph.type":["Entity"],"_value.%":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div>\n      <header>\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n        <nav>\n    \n    \n        <a href=\"https://open5g.info/architectures/\">Architectural Enablers of 5G Cellular Networks</a>\n        \n    \n        <a href=\"https://open5g.info/ran/\">Radio Access Network</a>\n        \n    \n        <a href=\"https://open5g.info/core/\">Core Network</a>\n        \n    \n        <a href=\"https://open5g.info/ran-frameworks/\">RAN and Core Frameworks</a>\n        \n    \n        <a href=\"https://open5g.info/virtualization/\">Open Virtualization and Management Frameworks</a>\n        \n    \n        <a href=\"https://open5g.info/sdr/\">Software Defined Radios</a>\n        \n    \n        <a href=\"https://open5g.info/testbeds/\">Open Testbeds</a>\n        \n    \n</nav>\n\n\n      </header>\n      <section>\n\n      <p>This website is an annotated list on recent open source software and frameworks for programmable and virtualized 5G cellular networks, with a full stack and end-to-end perspective.

Recent work suggests that the power of these massive models is captured by the representations they learn. Therefore, we seek a model that can relate between different existing representations and propose to solve this task with a conditionally invertible network. This network demonstrates its capability by (i) providing generic transfer between diverse domains, (ii) enabling controlled content synthesis by allowing modification in other domains, and (iii) facilitating diagnosis of existing representations by translating them into interpretable domains such as images. Our domain transfer network can translate between fixed representations without having to learn or finetune them. This allows users to utilize various existing domain-specific expert models from the literature that had been trained with extensive computational resources. Experiments on diverse conditional image synthesis tasks, competitive image modification results and experiments on image-to-image and text-to-image generation demonstrate the generic applicability of our approach. For example, we translate between BERT and BigGAN, state-of-the-art text and image models to provide text-to-image generation, which neither of both experts can perform on their own.\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n  <h6>\n    <a href=\"https://compvis.github.io/invariances/\">\n      Making Sense of CNNs: Interpreting Deep Representations &amp; Their Invariances with INNs\n    </a>\n  </h6>\n</p>\n<div>\n  <p><a href=\"https://compvis.github.io/invariances/\">\n      <img src=\"https://compvis.github.io/invariances/images/overview.jpg\">\n    </a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  To tackle increasingly complex tasks, it has become an essential ability of neural networks to learn abstract representations. These task-specific representations and, particularly, the invariances they capture turn neural networks into black box models that lack interpretability. To open such a black box, it is, therefore, crucial to uncover the different semantic concepts a model has learned as well as those that it has learned to be invariant to. We present an approach based on INNs that (i) recovers the task-specific, learned invariances by disentangling the remaining factor of variation in the data and that (ii) invertibly transforms these recovered invariances combined with the model representation into an equally expressive one with accessible semantic concepts. As a consequence, neural network representations become understandable by providing the means to (i) expose their semantic meaning, (ii) semantically modify a representation, and (iii) visualize individual learned semantic concepts and invariances. Our invertible approach significantly extends the abilities to understand black box models by enabling post-hoc interpretations of state-of-the-art networks without compromising their performance.\n  </p>\n\n\n<!-- /related works !-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<!-- Four -->\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"four\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>\n              <p>\n              This page is based on a design by <a href=\"http://templated.co/\">TEMPLATED</a>.\n              </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<!-- Scripts -->\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n</div>"},"type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/interface/textual"}]}}}},"abstract":{"uid":"_:2625","_value":{"uid":"_:2626","dgraph.type":["Interface"],"_value":{"uid":"_:2627","_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2628","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T05:41:33.158Z","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T05:41:31.63Z"},"dgraph.type":["Entity"],"_value.%":"TL;DR:\n                      We combine the efficiancy of convolutional approaches with\n                      the expressivity of transformers by introducing a\n                      convolutional VQGAN, which learns a codebook of\n                      context-rich visual parts, whose composition is modeled\n                      with an autoregressive transformer.","type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/note"}]}}},"type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/interface/textual"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2629","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T05:41:33.158Z","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T05:41:31.63Z"}}}},"unigraph.indexes":{"name":{"uid":"_:2612"}}}}}},{"uid":"_:2630","type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/rss_feed"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2631","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z"},"dgraph.type":["Entity","Deleted"],"_value":{"uid":"_:2632","site_info":{"uid":"_:2633","_value":{"uid":"_:2634","type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/web_bookmark"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2635","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z"},"_propertyType":"inheritance","dgraph.type":["Entity"],"_value":{"uid":"_:2636","url":{"uid":"_:2637","_value":{"uid":"_:2638","type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/url"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2639","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.986Z","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.986Z"},"dgraph.type":["Entity"],"_value.%":"https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqIggKIhxDQkFTRHdvSkwyMHZNRE5tYTNsM0VnSmxiaWdBUAE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"}},"favicon":{"uid":"_:2640","_value":{"uid":"_:2641","_value.%":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DR60l-K8vnyi99NZovm9HlXyZwQ85GMDxiwJWzoasZYCUrPuUM_P_4Rb7ei03j-0nRs0c4F=w48","dgraph.type":["Entity"],"type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/icon_url"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2642","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.986Z","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.986Z"}}},"creative_work":{"uid":"_:2643","_propertyType":"inheritance","_value":{"uid":"_:2644","type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/creative_work"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2645","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z"},"_value":{"uid":"_:2646","abstract":{"uid":"_:2647","_value":{"uid":"_:2648","_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2649","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z"},"dgraph.type":["Interface"],"_value":{"uid":"_:2650","_value.%":"Google News","dgraph.type":["Entity"],"type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/html"}]}},"_timestamp":{"uid":"_:2651","_createdAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z","_updatedAt":"2021-07-26T05:59:58.987Z"}},"type":{"$ref":{"query":[{"key":"unigraph.id","value":"$/schema/interface/textual"}]}}}}},"_propertyType":"inheritance","dgraph.type":["Entity"],"unigraph.indexes":{"name":{"uid":"_:2652"}}}},"name":{"uid":"_:2652","_value.%":"SpaceX -

open-source Python-like programming language which enables researchers with no CUDA experience to write highly efficient GPU code—most of the time on par with what an expert would be able to produce. Triton makes it possible to reach peak hardware performance with relatively little effort; for example, it can be used to write FP16 matrix multiplication kernels that match the performance of cuBLAS—something that many GPU programmers can't do—in under 25 lines of code. Our researchers have already used it to produce kernels that are up to 2x more efficient than equivalent Torch implementations, and we're excited to work with the community to make GPU programming more accessible to everyone.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><span>Novel research ideas</span> in the field of Deep Learning are generally implemented using a combination of native framework operators. While convenient, this approach often requires the creation (and/or movement) of many temporary tensors, which can hurt the performance of neural networks at scale. These issues can be mitigated by writing specialized GPU kernels, but doing so can be surprisingly difficult due to the many intricacies of GPU programming.<span data-id=\"gray-2017\"></span><span data-id=\"kerr-2020\"></span><span data-id=\"yan-2020\"></span> And, although a variety of systems have recently emerged<span data-id=\"cutlass\"></span><span data-id=\"tvm\"></span> to make this process easier, we have found them to be either too verbose, lack flexibility or generate code noticeably slower than our hand-tuned baselines. This has led us to extend and improve Triton<span data-id=\"tillet-2019\"></span>, a recent language and compiler whose original creator now works at OpenAI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenges-of-gpu-programming\">The Challenges of GPU Programming</h2>\n<p>The architecture of modern GPUs can be roughly divided into three major components—DRAM, SRAM and ALUs—each of which must be considered when optimizing CUDA code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Memory transfers from DRAM must be <em>coalesced</em> into large transactions to leverage the large bus width of modern memory interfaces.</li>\n<li>Data must be manually stashed to SRAM prior to being re-used, and managed so as to minimize shared memory bank conflicts upon retrieval.</li>\n<li>Computations must be partitioned and scheduled carefully, both across and within Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), so as to promote instruction/thread-level parallelism and leverage special-purpose ALUs (e.g., tensor cores).</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"gpuarchitecture\">\n<div>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.openai.com/triton/assets/gpu-architecture.svg\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.openai.com/triton/assets/gpu-architecture-small.svg\">\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>Basic architecture of a GPU.</p>\n</div><!-- end #gpuarchitecture -->\n<p>Reasoning about all these factors can be challenging, even for seasoned CUDA programmers with many years of experience. The purpose of Triton is to fully automate these optimizations, so that developers can better focus on the high-level logic of their parallel code.

Standard CUDA implementations of this parallelization strategy can be challenging to write, requiring explicit synchronization between threads as they concurrently reduce the same row of $X$. Most of this complexity goes away with Triton, where each kernel instance loads the row of interest and normalizes it sequentially using NumPy-like primitives.</p>\n<pre><code>import triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef softmax(Y, stride_ym, stride_yn, X, stride_xm, stride_xn, M, N):\n    # row index\n    m = tl.program_id(0)\n    # col indices\n    # this specific kernel only works for matrices that \n    # have less than BLOCK_SIZE columns\n    BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n    n = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n    # the memory address of all the elements\n    # that we want to load can be computed as follows\n    X = X + m * stride_xm + n * stride_xn\n    # load input data; pad out-of-bounds elements with 0 \n    x = tl.load(X, mask=n &lt; N, other=-float('inf'))\n    # compute numerically-stable softmax\n    z = x - tl.max(x, axis=0)\n    num = tl.exp(z)\n    denom = tl.sum(num, axis=0)\n    y = num / denom\n    # write back to Y\n    Y = Y + m * stride_ym + n * stride_yn\n    tl.store(Y, y, mask=n &lt; N)\n\nimport torch\n# Allocate input/output tensors\nX = torch.normal(0, 1, size=(583, 931), device='cuda')\nY = torch.empty_like(X)\n# SPMD launch grid\ngrid = (X.shape[0], )\n# enqueue GPU kernel\nsoftmax[grid](Y, Y.stride(0), Y.stride(1), \n              X, X.stride(0), X.stride(1),\n              X.shape[0]    , X.shape[1])\n</code></pre>\n<p>Fused softmax in Triton.</p>\n<p>Note that the Triton JIT treats X and Y as <em>pointers</em> rather than tensors; we felt like retaining low-level control of memory accesses was important to address more complex data structures (e.g., block-sparse tensors).</p>\n<p>Importantly, this particular implementation of softmax keeps the rows of $X$ in SRAM throughout the entire normalization process, which maximizes data reuse when applicable (~&lt;32K columns). This differs from PyTorch’s internal CUDA code, whose use of temporary memory makes it more general but significantly slower (below).

It would be a productivity tool that worked by a neat psychological hack, impressing yourself with your daily wins. “Often you discover that you’ve done more than you gave yourself credit for,” Chen says. “And this kind of motivates you—inspires you!”</p><p>Chen was a disenchanted lawyer; Guzman, a witty and talkative hacker. They built the tool in less than a week and launched it as IDoneThis. Soon they built an app by the same name and acquired 6,000 users. Within half a year, IDoneThis was the two creators’ full-time job.</p><p>But then those users started clamoring for more. People didn’t want merely to track the stuff they’d already done. They wanted to help plan for what they were going to do—from projects at work to the blizzard of tasks in their personal lives. Guzman and Chen updated IDoneThis with a new feature: to-do lists.</p><p>Which is when things went a little off the rails.</p><p>It wasn’t long before the two founders noticed something odd in the (anonymized) data they had on their users: People were lousy at finishing their to-dos. Chen and Guzman could see an accumulation of sprawling, ambitious lists of tasks that users utterly failed to accomplish. In 2014, fully 41 percent of to-do items on IDoneThis were never … done.</p><p>Sound familiar? The tasks you so diligently enter into your fancy app or productivity method linger for days or weeks or months (or even longer—one colleague recently told me his to-do app has undone tasks from 2019). They stare back, unchecked, with baleful expressions, disappointed at how very un-crossed-off they are.</p><figure></figure><p>Another thing that might feel familiar: The things that IDoneThis users actually did accomplish, they did very quickly. Half of completed to-do items were done within a day of writing them down. These weren’t longer-term, complex tasks. Ten percent were done within a minute. It was almost like people were writing them down just so they had something to check off. A nice psychological boost, to be sure, but it somewhat defeated the purpose of a to-do list.</p><p>More subtly, there was a big disjoint between the tasks people planned to do—i.e., wrote down on lists—and the tasks they actually did. Chen and Guzman found that when people reported their day’s accomplishments (the initial point of IDoneThis, you’ll recall), barely any of them had even appeared on a to-do list. The majority were tasks that users had just, well, remembered. Or maybe it was something that just popped into their head, or something a colleague had emailed them about.</p><p>The more Chen and Guzman pondered it, the more useless to-do lists seemed to be. They thought about getting rid of them. If to-do lists weren’t helping people accomplish stuff, what was the point? But they worried that users would squawk.</p><p>Which they might have, if they’d hung around—the founders noticed a frustratingly high churn rate. A minority would mind-meld with IDoneThis, but most would, in time, drift away on a seemingly endless hunt for the best way to manage their to-dos. “It involved a lot of, not dilettantes, but people who wanted to try something new or were interested in a different system,” Chen says.</p><p>People loved to write down their tasks. But that didn’t seem to help with completing them. Chen and Guzman became gradually chagrined. After five years of working on IDoneThis, they sold the company to a private equity firm. “We felt like we’d exhausted what we knew to do,” Guzman says. IDoneThis isn’t gone; you can still use it today. But its creators couldn’t shake the feeling that building the perfect system to effectively manage tasks was itself a task they couldn’t accomplish.</p><p>I think I know why: It might be impossible.</p><figure></figure><p><span>Most common office</span> tasks have well-settled&nbsp;software “solutions.” If I asked you to write a document, you’d probably use Word or Google Docs. To make a presentation, you’d pull up PowerPoint or Keynote or Google Slides.</p><p>Not so for to-dos. There is no Way That Everyone Does It. It’s a crazy Pokémon deck of options: Trello, Todoist, Gmail’s tasks, Microsoft To Do, Remember the Milk, Things, OmniFocus, Any.do,&nbsp;<br>Evernote’s Tasks, and Clear, to name just a few. And that doesn’t even count the whackload of us using one big ol’ Notepad file on our computers, or even plain old paper.</p><p>“There are <em>hundreds</em> of commercially available to-do lists right now,” says my friend Mark Hurst. Fifteen years ago he created one of the first productivity apps, Good Todo. Today it has a relatively small user base, but in general, productivity apps are big business; Americans downloaded them 7.1 billion times last year.</p><p>Chen and Guzman’s experience with trying to make one turns out to be common. The creators of personal to-do apps—or task management software, as it’s sometimes called—generally agree that they haven’t cracked the nut. Every one of these apps attempts to handle the same kind of basic actions: Give people a way to write down tasks, like “Get milk” or “Finish the sales memo,” and offer tools to sort and prioritize those tasks. Ideally, that improves your productivity, which broadly is how many things you can actually get done in a given amount of time. It seems easy enough.</p><p>But when I talk to folks who use these apps, I see a strange inconclusiveness. A scant minority of us check off everything every day. An equally tiny minority simply Cannot Even and are curled in a fetal ball awaiting imminent firing. But most of us? We’re just sort of … meh. We bounce from app to app, never quite finding a home. “I’ll try that one. I’ll try that one. I’ll try that one. Maybe this will do the magic!” as Randy Shulman, editor and publisher of <em>Metro Weekly</em>, Washington, DC’s LGBTQ paper, tells me. Sure, we’re getting work done! But we always feel slightly out of control, haunted by the to-dos at work and home that we just aren’t nailing.</p><p>The question is, why? Not just why it’s so hard to make a to-do app that works, but why people often feel so distraught by their hunt for the perfect organizational system. I’ve written about software for years, and I can tell you that people often have surprisingly deep feelings about their apps. But rarely is a category of software linked to such vistas of despair.</p><figure></figure><p><span>In the 1920s,</span> the German psychologist Kurt Lewin was dining in a restaurant and noticed something remarkable. As one version of the story goes, Lewin realized that the waiters were able to meticulously recall specific food orders—until they’d served the food and the customer was gone. After that, they couldn’t remember any of those details at all. Lewin’s student, a Soviet psychologist named Bluma Zeigarnik, became fascinated by this phenomenon. She started working on it in her lab. In a now <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://codeblab.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/On-Finished-and-Unfinished-Tasks.pdf&quot;}\" href=\"https://codeblab.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/On-Finished-and-Unfinished-Tasks.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">classic set of experiments</a>, she gave volunteers a series of tasks (assemble a cardboard box, make a figure out of clay, do some arithmetic). Then she’d interrupt them, checking to see what the volunteers actually remembered.</p><p>Zeigarnik found a quirk of the human mind: When a task is unfinished, we can’t seem to stop thinking about it. We perseverate. Psychologists still argue about why; possibly it’s a kind of constant refresh to keep whatever’s pending from vanishing from our short-term memory, like putting something by the front door at night so you don’t forget to take it with you the next morning.</p><p>Whatever the cause, today this is known as the Zeigarnik effect, and psychologists who study task management say it’s part of why so many of us feel perpetually frazzled by the challenge of organizing work and life. When we face all that undone stuff—emails to write, calls to return, people to contact, friends to check in on, memos to draft, children to help—it’s like being a waiter serving a hundred tables at once. If you’ve found yourself in bed at 2 am with your brain screaming at you about that thing you didn’t do, that’s a Zeigarnik moment.</p><figure></figure><p>A good to-do tool ought to ease the Zeigarnik effect. In 2011, psychologists E.&nbsp;J. Masicampo and Roy Baumeister <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://users.wfu.edu/masicaej/MasicampoBaumeister2011JPSP.pdf&quot;}\" href=\"http://users.wfu.edu/masicaej/MasicampoBaumeister2011JPSP.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">showed</a> that this does seem to be the case. They triggered the Zeigarnik effect in volunteers by giving them a task and not letting them complete it. It lingered in their minds and interfered with their ability to do other work. Then the psychologists allowed the subjects to write out a plan for how they’d get that outstanding task done, and, presto, it lessened the effect. Speccing out what you’re going to do—getting it outside of your head—seems to help you stop perseverating.</p><p>And indeed, those who regularly write down their to-dos seem to possess a mind less jittery. Shamarukh Chowdhury, a PhD student in psychology at Carleton University, has <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886917305081&quot;}\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886917305081\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that people who create to-do lists are less likely to procrastinate than those who don’t. More delightfully yet, a study by Baylor University psychologist Michael Scullin <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5758411/&quot;}\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5758411/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that people who created a to-do list fell asleep nine minutes faster, on average, than those who didn’t.</p><p>The creators of to-do apps all intuit the challenge of the Zeigarnik effect. They say that a key part of their apps is how frictionless they make it for us to input tasks. They’ve all worked to make this an instantaneous process: Open the app on your phone, shout at Siri or Alexa, or even email a new to-do item to your software.</p><p>Alas, this often makes things worse. Sure, the Zeigarnik effect is eased if you make a plan: I’ll do this, then do this, then do this, and then I’m done. One of the most famous productivity systems—David Allen’s Getting Things Done—is ruthlessly focused on rigorous planning and editing of tasks. It can take hours, but once you’ve done that hard work, you can plow through the tasks, one after another, with the metronomicity of a Chrysler line robot.</p><p>The problem is that we too often don’t really plan. Digital apps make it easy to add more tasks to the pile, and it feels good to get tasks out of our Zeigarnicized heads. So we do, frenetically.</p><p>“We call it snowballing,” says Amir Salihefendić, who founded the app Todoist in 2007; it currently has 30 million users. “They keep postponing stuff. And then suddenly you have a hundred tasks that you need to do.” Weeks or months later, your Todoist app is a teetering ziggurat of tasks, too painful even to behold. Omer Perchik, the creator of another app—Any.do—calls this problem “the List of Shame.”</p><p>And then what do we do? You’ve probably done it: We panic, give up, and quit. We “declare to-do bankruptcy.” We toss the list away in defeat and start fresh.</p><figure></figure><p>You can blame Zeigarnik again. The mere act of making a to-do list relieves so much itchy stress that it can, paradoxically, reduce the pressure to actually get stuff done. “People feel that when they put all their tasks somewhere, they’ve already done most of the work,” Perchik says. But it’s an illusion. The pile of work is still there.</p><p>More than a pile! If you feel adrift on a turbulent sea of unmanageable tasks, that might be because there is objectively more expected of us. By one estimate, work hours for those with college degrees went up about 7 percent between 1980 and 2016. Got a graduate degree? For you it went up more than 9 percent. And quite apart from one’s paid toil, there’s been an increase in social work—all the messaging and posts and social media garden-tending that the philosopher and technologist Ian Bogost calls “<a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/hyperemployment-or-the-exhausting-work-of-the-technology-user/281149/&quot;}\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/hyperemployment-or-the-exhausting-work-of-the-technology-user/281149/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hyperemployment</a>.”</p><p>(We could snap the lens open even wider and have a fuller reckoning with capitalism. Focusing on our individual ability to tread water—with apps and lists—can look like a bleak exercise in blaming the victim, when in reality the only solution is not better apps but non-hideous workloads, debt relief, and a saner landscape of civic care. Frankly, if you took “managing grotesquely useless and bloodsucking for-profit health insurance” off people’s to-do lists, it would remove one remarkably stressful item, as my Canadian upbringing compels me to suggest. But I’m writing this particular article from within the belly of the whale, as it were.)</p><p>No matter whose fault it is, we take this stuff personally. American to-do behavior has a deeply puritan streak. Benjamin Franklin was among the first to pioneer to-do lists, creating a <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Autobiography_of_Benjamin_Franklin/cJgVAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=autobiography%20of%20benjamin%20franklin&amp;pg=PA153&amp;printsec=frontcover&quot;}\" href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Autobiography_of_Benjamin_Franklin/cJgVAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=autobiography%20of%20benjamin%20franklin&amp;pg=PA153&amp;printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">checklist</a> of “virtues”—temperance! frugality! moderation!—that he intended to practice every day. That’s what the information scientist Gilly Leshed and computer scientist and cultural theorist Phoebe Sengers, both at Cornell University, <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979077&quot;}\" href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979077\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> when they talked to people about their to-do lists. “They abide by the norm of ‘We need to be productive citizens of this world,’” Leshed tells me. Doing more is doing good.</p><p>To-do lists are, in the American imagination, a curiously moral type of software. Nobody opens Google Docs or PowerPoint thinking “This will make me a better person.” But with to-do apps, that ambition is front and center. “Everyone thinks that, with this system, I’m going to be like the best parent, the best child, the best worker, the most organized, punctual friend,” says Monique Mongeon, a product manager at the book-sales-tracking firm BookNet and a self-admitted serial organizational-app devotee. “When you start using something to organize your life, it’s because you’re hoping to improve it in some way. You’re trying to solve something.”</p><p>With to-do apps, we are attempting nothing less than to craft a superior version of ourselves. Perhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise that when we fail, the moods run so black.</p><figure></figure><p><span>Programmers often describe</span> software as being “<a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/802050/what-is-opinionated-software&quot;}\" href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/802050/what-is-opinionated-software\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opinionated</a>.” In the guise of helping us try to do things, productivity software recommends we do them in a particular way. A to-do app is offering an opinion about how we ought to organize our lives, which is, when you think about it, a kind of intense opinion for a piece of code to hold, right?</p><p>This is part of why we have such strong feelings about any given task-management tool. We either love it or hold it in bitter contempt.</p><p>Jesse Patel created the app Workflowy because he had ADHD and wanted a tool that worked as his mind required. In the late 2000s he was working as a head of business development, with “five different big-picture opportunity areas and, like, 30 different subprojects in each of those. It was just so overwhelming.” He noticed that each work task tended to spawn tons of subtasks. But most software, he found, wasn’t great at allowing for that Russian-nesting-doll quality. He wanted a “fractal” tool where every to-do could contain more little to-dos inside it.</p><p>So he taught himself to program and created Workflowy to function just so: When you open a new project, you write items that can spawn endless sub-items, all of which can be dragged around and reorganized. If things look too cluttered, you can collapse everything so you see only your top-level tasks. “It’s a universe for your thoughts,” Patel says.</p><figure></figure><p>It’s a big universe—250,000 active users, like the construction site manager who told Patel that he made items for each room, with sub-items for anything the room needed. (“That room has, like, four missing bolts.”) I heard from people who loved Workflowy; I also heard from people who thought the whole fractal thing was a dead end. Salihefendić’s app Todoist once allowed levels upon levels of subtasks, but he got rid of them after noticing that only a fraction of people used them, and they were mostly just dorking around, organizing their subtasks instead of actually doing work.</p><p>Pick virtually any postulate about “the best way to get organized” and app designers will have diametrically opposing views. The app Things lets you put a due date on each task; Hurst, the founder of Good Todo, hissingly denounces due dates as a form of productivity self-harm that turns into a screenful of blinking red overdue alerts.</p><p>So the software is opinionated, as are its makers. But they’re also weirdly humble. Most of the app builders I spoke with admitted that, for many who try their tool, it won’t help. Maybe their app doesn’t match the way that customer’s mind works. Maybe the customer is a hot mess. Maybe their workload is unreasonable. Either way, the app creators are surprisingly willing to admit defeat. April Ramm, who does customer support for OmniFocus, will sometimes recommend a rival app to a potential customer.</p><p>This stance is … kind of unusual in the world of software, yes? One rarely hears founders candidly admit that their tool probably won’t fulfill its stated goal for many users, much less that it probably isn’t specifically right for you, either.</p><figure></figure><p><span>For years, I</span> had a very rudimentary to-do system. Using a piece of paper, or maybe a document on my PC, I’d list my main areas of work (“WIRED Column,” “Household,” and so on). Then I’d write out all my tasks under each heading. (Under “WIRED Column”: “Call scientist about study.”) Finally, I’d make a plan. I’d number all my subtasks. Typically I’d hopscotch from project to project: My number one task would be the fourth item under “Household,” then number two was the seventh item under “WIRED Column,” and so on. Finally, with my plan laid out, I could power through my list.</p><p>Or at least I’d try to. Sometimes my system would work for days or weeks, but eventually it’d balloon into a List of Shame, and I’d guiltily declare bankruptcy.</p><p>I often suspected the problem was that my system was visually confusing. I had to scan the page to figure out what my next item was. Wouldn’t it be nice if, instead, I could click a button and my to-dos would arrange themselves in numerical order?</p><p>So I decided to make the app myself. I’m a hobbyist programmer, and I figured this spec was simple enough that even my hazy coding skills could pull it off.</p><p>One evening a year ago, I sat down and bashed out a prototype. The next day I started using it and found, to my delight, that it worked much as I’d hoped. I now had a numbered list I could sort and unsort quickly. I used it every day for months. Projects came and went; I filed stories and juggled tons of household errands. It felt lovely to have a tool designed for precisely the way my mind worked.</p><p>The thing is, it didn’t improve my productivity. It certainly did not increase how much paid work I accomplished. I was still filing the same number of stories, and doing the same life chores, in the same amount of time. I still found myself getting piled up and spiraling into to-do bankruptcy.</p><p>Sure, I could visualize my tasks better. But that didn’t move the needle on my efficiency. In fact, one day while working on the very story you’re reading now, I found myself staring at a monstrous List of Shame in my app. I declared bankruptcy, and then I shakily pulled out a single piece of paper and reprioritized, writing down a small handful of things I could actually accomplish.</p><p>I still use my app, intermittently. But building it made me realize a grim fact about to-do software, which is that even the most bespoke, personalized version couldn’t unfrazzle my mind. And after dozens of interviews with users and coders, talking to them about my failure—and theirs—I began to realize that a big part of our problem lies deeper than interfaces or list-making. It’s in the nature of time itself, and our relationship to it.</p><figure></figure><p><span>If you ask</span> people to accomplish a loony amount&nbsp;of work this week, they’ll go, <em>No way. Can’t be done</em>. But if you tell them they’ll need to do that same bonkers amount in a single week one year from now? They’ll think, <em>OK, sure, I could do that</em>.</p><p>Something about the future defeats our imaginative capacity. “Present self screws over future self,” says Tim Pychyl, a psychologist at Carleton University who studies procrastination. He says that we regard our future self as a stranger, someone onto whose lap we can dump tons of work. On some weird level, we don’t get that it’ll be us doing it.</p><p>One of Pychyl’s students recently tried a clever experimental trick to get people to procrastinate less. The student took undergraduates through a guided meditation exercise in which they envisioned themselves at the end of the term—meeting that future self. “Lo and behold,” Pychyl says, those people “developed more empathy for their future self, and that was related to a decrease in procrastination.” They realized that time wasn’t infinite. Future them was no longer a stranger but someone to be protected. To get us off our butts, it seems, we need to grapple with the finite nature of our time on Earth.</p><p>This is the black-metal nature of task management: Every single time you write down a task for yourself, you are deciding how to spend a few crucial moments of the most nonrenewable resource you possess: your life. Every to-do list is, ultimately, about death. (“Dost thou love life?” wrote Ben Franklin. “Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of.”)</p><figure></figure><p>I began to suspect that this is the truly deep, arterial source of some of the emotions around to-do lists. The people who make to-do apps agreed with me. “What is this class of software supposed to do?” asks Patel, the creator of Workflowy, rhetorically. “It’s supposed to answer the question ‘What should I do right now in order to accomplish all of my life goals?’ The most scarce resource many of us have is time.”</p><p>Ryder Carroll, the creator of the Bullet Journal paper-based method for organizing your work, puts it in even more starkly existential terms. “Each task is an experience waiting to be born,” he tells me. “When you look at your task list that way, it’s like, this will become your future.” (Or if you want the European literary-philosophical take, <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-umberto-eco-we-like-lists-because-we-don-t-want-to-die-a-659577.html&quot;}\" href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-umberto-eco-we-like-lists-because-we-don-t-want-to-die-a-659577.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here’s</a> Umberto Eco: “We like lists because we don’t want to die.”)</p><p>No wonder we get so paralyzed! The stakes with PowerPoint really aren’t that high.</p><p>Given that life is composed of time, a whole sector of the task-management philosophical magisteria argues that mere lists will always be inherently terrible. Just as Pychyl showed, we overload ourselves with more than we can accomplish and create Lists of Shame because we are terrible at grasping how little time we actually have. The only solution, this line of thinking goes, is to use an organizational system that is itself composed of time: a calendar.</p><p>Instead of putting tasks on a list, you do “time blocking,” putting every task in your calendar as a chunk of work. That way you can immediately see when you’re biting off more than you can chew. Cal Newport, a computer scientist at Georgetown University and guru of what he calls “deep work,” is probably the staunchest advocate of time blocking. “I think it is pretty undeniable that time blocking, done well, is going to blow the list method out of the water,” Newport tells me. He says it makes you twice as productive as those suckers who rely on lists. Time blocking forces us to wrestle directly with the angel of death. It’s natural that we then screw around less.</p><p>Several researchers who study tasks told me they generally agreed that time blocking avoids the problems of to-do apps and lists. One to-do app, Reclaim, actually has an AI that estimates how long each task will take and finds a slot in your calendar. (The secret point is to show you there isn’t much room in there.) “We’ll not only tell you when tasks are overdue, we’ll tell you that tasks are <em>going</em> to be overdue,” says Patrick Lightbody, Reclaim’s cofounder.</p><p>Though, as you might expect by this point, other productivity thinkers are equally vehement that calendars alone won’t save you. You also have to develop a Jedi-like ability to say no to your own craving to do more, more, more. Salihefendić says the people who are “really into” Todoist—and most productive—are fanatical about completing more tasks than they add.</p><p>In this vein, a whole bench of task-management philosophers believe that the best interface isn’t digital at all—it’s paper.</p><p>Paper forces you to repetitively rewrite tasks, as when, say, you transfer all last week’s undone to-dos to this week’s list, or when you erase and rewrite calendar events. That’s what I do when the productivity software I wrote for myself fails me. “Making that choice over and over again,” Carroll tells me, “is the first opportunity where you’re like, ‘Why am I doing this?’” The inconvenience can be clarifying. Making a list on a sheet of paper is an unusually rich metaphor for life: It takes effort, and the space fills up more quickly than you expect.</p><p>The usefulness of paper here cuts to the real heart of what makes to-do management such a grim problem. Apps, lists, and calendars can help us put our priorities in order, sure. But only we can figure out what those goals are. And setting limits on what we hope to do is philosophically painful. Every to-do list is a midlife crisis of unfulfilled promise. Winnowing away things you’ll never do in a weekly review is crucial, yet we dread it for what it says about the boundaries of existence. Our fragile psyches find it easier to build up a list of shame, freak out, and flee.</p><p>This is what makes to-do software unique. The majority of tools we use in our jobs are about communicating with someone else. All that messaging, all those Google docs, all that email—it’s about talking to other people, documenting things for them, trying to persuade them. But a to-do list is, ultimately, nothing more or less than an attempt to persuade yourself.</p><hr><p>More Great WIRED Stories</p><ul><li>📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/newsletter?sourceCode=BottomStories\">Get our newsletters</a>!</li><li>A people's history of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/black-twitter-oral-history-part-i-coming-together/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc\">Black Twitter</a>, part I</li><li>The latest twist in the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/life-on-venus-debate-phosphine-volcanoes/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc\">life-on-Venus debate</a>?

<span>Abstract:</span>  We report a new system of artificial life called Lenia (from Latin lenis\n\"smooth\"), a two-dimensional cellular automaton with continuous\nspace-time-state and generalized local rule. Computer simulations show that\nLenia supports a great diversity of complex autonomous patterns or \"lifeforms\"\nbearing resemblance to real-world microscopic organisms. More than 400 species\nin 18 families have been identified, many discovered via interactive\nevolutionary computation. They differ from other cellular automata patterns in\nbeing geometric, metameric, fuzzy, resilient, adaptive, and rule-generic.\n<br>We present basic observations of the system regarding the properties of\nspace-time and basic settings.

/ Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>L</span>ast year, the cover of <i>New Scientist</i> ran the headline, “Is the Universe Conscious?” Mathematician and physicist Johannes Kleiner, at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy in Germany, told author Michael Brooks that a mathematically precise definition of consciousness could mean that the cosmos is suffused with subjective experience. “This could be the beginning of a scientific revolution,” Kleiner <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24632800-900-is-the-universe-conscious-it-seems-impossible-until-you-do-the-maths/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, referring to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07655\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> he and others have been conducting.&nbsp;</p><p>Kleiner and his colleagues are focused on the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, one of the more prominent theories of consciousness today. As Kleiner notes, IIT (as the theory is known) is thoroughly panpsychist because all integrated information has at least one bit of consciousness.&nbsp;</p><p>You might see the rise of panpsychism as part of a Copernican trend—the idea that we’re not special. The Earth is not the center of the universe. Humans are not a treasured creation, or even the pinnacle of evolution. So why should we think that creatures with brains, like us, are the sole bearers of consciousness? In fact, panpsychism has been around for thousands of years as one of various solutions to the <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/79/catalysts/where-is-my-mind\" target=\"_blank\">mind-body problem</a>. David Skrbina’s 2007 book, <i>Panpsychism in the West</i>, provides an excellent history of this intellectual tradition.</p><blockquote><p>Electrons may have some type of extremely rudimentary mind.</p> </blockquote><p>While there are many versions of panpsychism, the version I find appealing is known as <i>constitutive panpsychism</i>. It states, to put it simply, that all matter has some associated mind or consciousness, and vice versa. Where there is mind there is matter and where there is matter there is mind. They go together. As modern panpsychists like Alfred North Whitehead, David Ray Griffin, Galen Strawson, and others have argued, all matter has some capacity for feeling, albeit highly rudimentary feeling in most configurations of matter.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Panpsychists look at the many rungs on the complexity ladder of nature and see no obvious line between mind and no-mind. Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked in 1974 what is it like to be a bat, to echolocate and fly? We can’t know with any certainty, but we can reasonably infer, based on observation of their complex behaviors and the close genetic kinship between all mammals and humans—and the fact that evolution proceeds incrementally—that bats have a rich inner life. By the same logic, we can look steadily at less-complex forms of behavior that allow us to reasonably infer some kind of mind associated with all types of matter. Yes, including even the lowly electron.&nbsp;</p><p>While inanimate matter doesn’t evolve like animate matter, inanimate matter does behave. It does things. It responds to forces. Electrons move in certain ways that differ under different experimental conditions. These types of behaviors have prompted respected physicists to suggest that electrons may have some type of extremely rudimentary mind. For example the late <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/43/heroes/my-life-with-the-physics-dream-team\" target=\"_blank\">Freeman Dyson</a>, the well-known American physicist, stated in his 1979 book, <i>Disturbing the Universe</i>, that “the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states which we call ‘chance’ when made by electrons.” Quantum chance is better framed as quantum choice—choice, not chance, at every level of nature. David Bohm, another well-known American physicist, argued similarly: “The ability of form to be active is the most characteristic feature of mind, and we have something that is mind-like already with the electron.”</p><p>Many biologists and philosophers have recognized that there is no hard line between animate and inanimate. J.B.S. Haldane, the eminent British biologist, supported the view that there is no clear demarcation line between what is alive and what is not: “We do not find obvious evidence of life or mind in so-called inert matter…; but if the scientific point of view is correct, we shall ultimately find them, at least in rudimentary form, all through the universe.”</p><div id=\"inpagesub\">\n\t<p>Get the <span>Nautilus</span> newsletter</p>\n<p>\n\tThe newest and most popular articles delivered right to your inbox!\n</p>\n\t\t\t<!-- Begin MailChimp Signup Form -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n</div><p>Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist who was seminal in developing quantum theory, stated that the “very definitions of life and mechanics … are ultimately a matter of convenience…. [T]he question of a limitation of physics in biology would lose any meaning if, instead of distinguishing between living organisms and inanimate bodies, we extended the idea of life to all natural phenomena.”</p><p>More recently, University of Colorado astrobiologist Bruce Jakosky, who has worked with NASA in the search for extraterrestrial life, asked rhetorically: “Was there a distinct moment when Earth went from having no life to having life, as if a switch were flipped? The answer is ‘probably not.’”</p><p>Theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, author of the 2018 book <i>Lost in Math</i>, has taken a contrary position. “[I]f you want a particle to be conscious, your minimum expectation should be that the particle can change,” she argued in a post titled “<a href=\"http://nautil.us/blog/electrons-dont-think\" target=\"_blank\">Electrons Don’t Think</a>.” “It’s hard to have an inner life with only one thought. But if electrons could have thoughts, we’d long have seen this in particle collisions because it would change the number of particles produced in collisions.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yet “change” means many different things, including position in space over time. What Dyson is getting at in his remark about electrons and quantum theory is that the probabilistic distribution-outcomes of quantum experiments (like the double-slit experiment) are better explained as the product, not of pure chance (another way of saying “we don’t know”), but of numerous highly rudimentary choices by each electron in each moment about where and how to manifest.&nbsp;</p><p>Whitehead’s <a href=\"https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm\" target=\"_blank\">variety of panpsychism</a>, still the most worked-out version of panpsychism today, re-envisions the nature of matter in a fundamental way. For Whitehead, all actual entities, including electrons, atoms, and molecules, are “drops of experience” in that they enjoy at least a little bit of experience, a little bit of awareness. At first blush it’s a strange perspective but eventually makes a great deal of sense.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than being unchanging things moving around in a container of space-time—the modern view in a nutshell—Whitehead conceives of particles like electrons as a chain of successive iterations of a single electron that bear a strong likeness to each other in each iteration, but are not identical to each other. Each iteration is a little different than the last. There is no static and unchanging electron. The degree to which each iteration is more or less different than the last iteration is the place for an iota of choice, and mind. This iota of choice compounds upwards and, through the course of biological evolution, results in the complex types of mind and choice that we humans and other mammals enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Whitehead, a mathematical philosopher, fleshed out in detail this process of “concrescence,” the oscillating nature of entities like electrons moment to moment, in his philosophical works <i>Science and the Modern World</i>, <i>Process and Reality</i>, and <i>Modes of Thought</i>. These are sometimes difficult works but are well worth the struggle to get through if you’re interested in basing physics on a more empirical metaphysical foundation.</p><p>Many modern thinkers have come to embrace Whitehead and panpsychism to varying degrees, including Bohm, whose <i>Wholeness and the Implicate Order</i>, his <i>magnum opus</i> on modern physics and the nature of reality, refers to Whitehead as an inspiration.&nbsp;</p><p>I am fleshing out in my work how we can turn these “merely” philosophical considerations about the nature of mind throughout nature into a testable set of experiments, with some early thoughts sketched <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/wheres-my-consciousness-ometer/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

As Kleiner notes, IIT (as the theory is known) is thoroughly panpsychist because all integrated information has at least one bit of consciousness. </p><p>You might see the rise of panpsychism as part of a Copernican trend—the idea that we’re not special. The Earth is not the center of the universe. Humans are not a treasured creation, or even the pinnacle of evolution. So why should we think that creatures with brains, like us, are the sole bearers of consciousness? In fact, panpsychism has been around for thousands of years as one of various solutions to the <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/79/catalysts/where-is-my-mind\" target=\"_blank\">mind-body problem</a>. David Skrbina’s 2007 book, <i>Panpsychism in the West</i>, provides an excellent history of this intellectual tradition.</p><p>Electrons may have some type of extremely rudimentary mind.</p> <p>While there are many versions of panpsychism, the version I find appealing is known as <i>constitutive panpsychism</i>. It states, to put it simply, that all matter has some associated mind or consciousness, and vice versa. Where there is mind there is matter and where there is matter there is mind. They go together. As modern panpsychists like Alfred North Whitehead, David Ray Griffin, Galen Strawson, and others have argued, all matter has some capacity for feeling, albeit highly rudimentary feeling in most configurations of matter. </p><p>Panpsychists look at the many rungs on the complexity ladder of nature and see no obvious line between mind and no-mind. Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked in 1974 what is it like to be a bat, to echolocate and fly? We can’t know with any certainty, but we can reasonably infer, based on observation of their complex behaviors and the close genetic kinship between all mammals and humans—and the fact that evolution proceeds incrementally—that bats have a rich inner life. By the same logic, we can look steadily at less-complex forms of behavior that allow us to reasonably infer some kind of mind associated with all types of matter. Yes, including even the lowly electron. </p><p>While inanimate matter doesn’t evolve like animate matter, inanimate matter does behave. It does things. It responds to forces. Electrons move in certain ways that differ under different experimental conditions. These types of behaviors have prompted respected physicists to suggest that electrons may have some type of extremely rudimentary mind. For example the late <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/43/heroes/my-life-with-the-physics-dream-team\" target=\"_blank\">Freeman Dyson</a>, the well-known American physicist, stated in his 1979 book, <i>Disturbing the Universe</i>, that “the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states which we call ‘chance’ when made by electrons.” Quantum chance is better framed as quantum choice—choice, not chance, at every level of nature. David Bohm, another well-known American physicist, argued similarly: “The ability of form to be active is the most characteristic feature of mind, and we have something that is mind-like already with the electron.”</p><p>Many biologists and philosophers have recognized that there is no hard line between animate and inanimate. J.B.S. Haldane, the eminent British biologist, supported the view that there is no clear demarcation line between what is alive and what is not: “We do not find obvious evidence of life or mind in so-called inert matter…; but if the scientific point of view is correct, we shall ultimately find them, at least in rudimentary form, all through the universe.”</p><p>Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist who was seminal in developing quantum theory, stated that the “very definitions of life and mechanics … are ultimately a matter of convenience…. [T]he question of a limitation of physics in biology would lose any meaning if, instead of distinguishing between living organisms and inanimate bodies, we extended the idea of life to all natural phenomena.”</p><p>More recently, University of Colorado astrobiologist Bruce Jakosky, who has worked with NASA in the search for extraterrestrial life, asked rhetorically: “Was there a distinct moment when Earth went from having no life to having life, as if a switch were flipped? The answer is ‘probably not.’”</p><p>Theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, author of the 2018 book <i>Lost in Math</i>, has taken a contrary position. “[I]f you want a particle to be conscious, your minimum expectation should be that the particle can change,” she argued in a post titled “<a href=\"http://nautil.us/blog/electrons-dont-think\" target=\"_blank\">Electrons Don’t Think</a>.” “It’s hard to have an inner life with only one thought. But if electrons could have thoughts, we’d long have seen this in particle collisions because it would change the number of particles produced in collisions.” </p><p>Yet “change” means many different things, including position in space over time. What Dyson is getting at in his remark about electrons and quantum theory is that the probabilistic distribution-outcomes of quantum experiments (like the double-slit experiment) are better explained as the product, not of pure chance (another way of saying “we don’t know”), but of numerous highly rudimentary choices by each electron in each moment about where and how to manifest. </p><p>Whitehead’s <a href=\"https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm\" target=\"_blank\">variety of panpsychism</a>, still the most worked-out version of panpsychism today, re-envisions the nature of matter in a fundamental way. For Whitehead, all actual entities, including electrons, atoms, and molecules, are “drops of experience” in that they enjoy at least a little bit of experience, a little bit of awareness. At first blush it’s a strange perspective but eventually makes a great deal of sense. </p><p>Rather than being unchanging things moving around in a container of space-time—the modern view in a nutshell—Whitehead conceives of particles like electrons as a chain of successive iterations of a single electron that bear a strong likeness to each other in each iteration, but are not identical to each other. Each iteration is a little different than the last. There is no static and unchanging electron. The degree to which each iteration is more or less different than the last iteration is the place for an iota of choice, and mind. This iota of choice compounds upwards and, through the course of biological evolution, results in the complex types of mind and choice that we humans and other mammals enjoy. </p><p>Whitehead, a mathematical philosopher, fleshed out in detail this process of “concrescence,” the oscillating nature of entities like electrons moment to moment, in his philosophical works <i>Science and the Modern World</i>, <i>Process and Reality</i>, and <i>Modes of Thought</i>. These are sometimes difficult works but are well worth the struggle to get through if you’re interested in basing physics on a more empirical metaphysical foundation.</p><p>Many modern thinkers have come to embrace Whitehead and panpsychism to varying degrees, including Bohm, whose <i>Wholeness and the Implicate Order</i>, his <i>magnum opus</i> on modern physics and the nature of reality, refers to Whitehead as an inspiration. </p><p>I am fleshing out in my work how we can turn these “merely” philosophical considerations about the nature of mind throughout nature into a testable set of experiments, with some early thoughts sketched <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/wheres-my-consciousness-ometer/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Such experiments move debates about panpsychism out of the realm of philosophy and more firmly into the realm of science. </p><p>So, yes, there is plenty of room in modern physics for electrons to “think.” </p><p><i>Tam Hunt is a scholar and writer affiliated with the University of California, Santa Barbara.

the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy in Germany, told author Michael Brooks that a mathematically precise definition of consciousness could mean that the cosmos is suffused with subjective experience. “This could be the beginning of a scientific revolution,” Kleiner <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24632800-900-is-the-universe-conscious-it-seems-impossible-until-you-do-the-maths/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, referring to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07655\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> he and others have been conducting.&nbsp;</p><p>Kleiner and his colleagues are focused on the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, one of the more prominent theories of consciousness today. As Kleiner notes, IIT (as the theory is known) is thoroughly panpsychist because all integrated information has at least one bit of consciousness.&nbsp;</p><p>You might see the rise of panpsychism as part of a Copernican trend—the idea that we’re not special. The Earth is not the center of the universe. Humans are not a treasured creation, or even the pinnacle of evolution. So why should we think that creatures with brains, like us, are the sole bearers of consciousness? In fact, panpsychism has been around for thousands of years as one of various solutions to the <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/79/catalysts/where-is-my-mind\" target=\"_blank\">mind-body problem</a>. David Skrbina’s 2007 book, <i>Panpsychism in the West</i>, provides an excellent history of this intellectual tradition.</p><blockquote><p>Electrons may have some type of extremely rudimentary mind.</p> </blockquote><p>While there are many versions of panpsychism, the version I find appealing is known as <i>constitutive panpsychism</i>. It states, to put it simply, that all matter has some associated mind or consciousness, and vice versa. Where there is mind there is matter and where there is matter there is mind. They go together. As modern panpsychists like Alfred North Whitehead, David Ray Griffin, Galen Strawson, and others have argued, all matter has some capacity for feeling, albeit highly rudimentary feeling in most configurations of matter.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Panpsychists look at the many rungs on the complexity ladder of nature and see no obvious line between mind and no-mind. Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked in 1974 what is it like to be a bat, to echolocate and fly? We can’t know with any certainty, but we can reasonably infer, based on observation of their complex behaviors and the close genetic kinship between all mammals and humans—and the fact that evolution proceeds incrementally—that bats have a rich inner life. By the same logic, we can look steadily at less-complex forms of behavior that allow us to reasonably infer some kind of mind associated with all types of matter. Yes, including even the lowly electron.&nbsp;</p><p>While inanimate matter doesn’t evolve like animate matter, inanimate matter does behave. It does things. It responds to forces. Electrons move in certain ways that differ under different experimental conditions. These types of behaviors have prompted respected physicists to suggest that electrons may have some type of extremely rudimentary mind. For example the late <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/43/heroes/my-life-with-the-physics-dream-team\" target=\"_blank\">Freeman Dyson</a>, the well-known American physicist, stated in his 1979 book, <i>Disturbing the Universe</i>, that “the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states which we call ‘chance’ when made by electrons.” Quantum chance is better framed as quantum choice—choice, not chance, at every level of nature. David Bohm, another well-known American physicist, argued similarly: “The ability of form to be active is the most characteristic feature of mind, and we have something that is mind-like already with the electron.”</p><p>Many biologists and philosophers have recognized that there is no hard line between animate and inanimate. J.B.S. Haldane, the eminent British biologist, supported the view that there is no clear demarcation line between what is alive and what is not: “We do not find obvious evidence of life or mind in so-called inert matter…; but if the scientific point of view is correct, we shall ultimately find them, at least in rudimentary form, all through the universe.”</p><div id=\"inpagesub\">\n\t<p>Get the <span>Nautilus</span> newsletter</p>\n<p>\n\tThe newest and most popular articles delivered right to your inbox!\n</p>\n\t\t\t<!-- Begin MailChimp Signup Form -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n</div><p>Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist who was seminal in developing quantum theory, stated that the “very definitions of life and mechanics … are ultimately a matter of convenience….

The answer is ‘probably not.’”</p><p>Theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, author of the 2018 book <i>Lost in Math</i>, has taken a contrary position. “[I]f you want a particle to be conscious, your minimum expectation should be that the particle can change,” she argued in a post titled “<a href=\"http://nautil.us/blog/electrons-dont-think\" target=\"_blank\">Electrons Don’t Think</a>.” “It’s hard to have an inner life with only one thought. But if electrons could have thoughts, we’d long have seen this in particle collisions because it would change the number of particles produced in collisions.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yet “change” means many different things, including position in space over time. What Dyson is getting at in his remark about electrons and quantum theory is that the probabilistic distribution-outcomes of quantum experiments (like the double-slit experiment) are better explained as the product, not of pure chance (another way of saying “we don’t know”), but of numerous highly rudimentary choices by each electron in each moment about where and how to manifest.&nbsp;</p><p>Whitehead’s <a href=\"https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm\" target=\"_blank\">variety of panpsychism</a>, still the most worked-out version of panpsychism today, re-envisions the nature of matter in a fundamental way. For Whitehead, all actual entities, including electrons, atoms, and molecules, are “drops of experience” in that they enjoy at least a little bit of experience, a little bit of awareness. At first blush it’s a strange perspective but eventually makes a great deal of sense.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than being unchanging things moving around in a container of space-time—the modern view in a nutshell—Whitehead conceives of particles like electrons as a chain of successive iterations of a single electron that bear a strong likeness to each other in each iteration, but are not identical to each other. Each iteration is a little different than the last. There is no static and unchanging electron. The degree to which each iteration is more or less different than the last iteration is the place for an iota of choice, and mind. This iota of choice compounds upwards and, through the course of biological evolution, results in the complex types of mind and choice that we humans and other mammals enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Whitehead, a mathematical philosopher, fleshed out in detail this process of “concrescence,” the oscillating nature of entities like electrons moment to moment, in his philosophical works <i>Science and the Modern World</i>, <i>Process and Reality</i>, and <i>Modes of Thought</i>. These are sometimes difficult works but are well worth the struggle to get through if you’re interested in basing physics on a more empirical metaphysical foundation.</p><p>Many modern thinkers have come to embrace Whitehead and panpsychism to varying degrees, including Bohm, whose <i>Wholeness and the Implicate Order</i>, his <i>magnum opus</i> on modern physics and the nature of reality, refers to Whitehead as an inspiration.&nbsp;</p><p>I am fleshing out in my work how we can turn these “merely” philosophical considerations about the nature of mind throughout nature into a testable set of experiments, with some early thoughts sketched <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/wheres-my-consciousness-ometer/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

Initially proposed by Giulio Tononi in 2004, it claims that consciousness is identical to a certain kind of information, the realization of which requires physical, not merely functional, integration, and which can be measured mathematically according to the <em>phi</em> metric.</p>\n<p>The theory attempts a balance between two different sets of convictions. On the one hand, it strives to preserve the Cartesian intuitions that experience is immediate, direct, and unified. This, according to IIT’s proponents and its methodology, rules out accounts of consciousness such as functionalism that explain experience as a system operating in a certain way, as well as ruling out any eliminativist theories that deny the existence of consciousness. On the other hand, IIT takes neuroscientific descriptions of the brain as a starting point for understanding what must be true of a physical system in order for it to be conscious. (Most of IIT’s developers and main proponents are neuroscientists.) IIT’s methodology involves characterizing the fundamentally subjective nature of consciousness and positing the physical attributes necessary for a system to realize it.</p>\n<p>In short, according to IIT, consciousness requires a grouping of elements within a system that have physical cause-effect power upon one another. This in turn implies that only reentrant architecture consisting of feedback loops, whether neural or computational, will realize consciousness. Such groupings make a difference to themselves, not just to outside observers. This constitutes integrated information. Of the various groupings within a system that possess such causal power, one will do so maximally. This local maximum of integrated information is identical to consciousness.</p>\n<p>IIT claims that these predictions square with observations of the brain’s physical realization of consciousness, and that, where the brain does not instantiate the necessary attributes, it does not generate consciousness. Bolstered by these apparent predictive successes, IIT generalizes its claims beyond human consciousness to animal and artificial consciousness. Because IIT identifies the subjective experience of consciousness with objectively measurable dynamics of a system, the degree of consciousness of a system is measurable in principle; IIT proposes the phi metric to quantify consciousness.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#H1\">The Main Argument</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH1a\">Cartesian Commitments</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH1ai\">Axioms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH1aii\">Postulates</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH1b\">The Identity of Consciousness</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH1bi\">Some Predictions</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH1c\">Characterizing the Argument</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H2\">The <em>Phi</em> Metric</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH2a\">The Main Idea</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH2b\">Some Issues of Application</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H3\">Situating the Theory</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH3a\">Some Prehistory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH3b\">IIT’s Additional&nbsp;Support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH3c\">IIT as <em>Sui Generis</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH3d\">Relation to Panpsychism</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH3di\">Relation to David Chalmers</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H4\">Implications</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH4a\">The Spectrum of Consciousness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH4b\">IIT and Physics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH4c\">Artificial Consciousness</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH4ci\">Constraints on Structure/Architecture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH4cii\">Relation to “Silent Neurons”</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H5\">Objections</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH5a\">The Functionalist Alternative</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH5ai\">Rejecting Cartesian Commitments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH5aii\">Case Study: Access <em>vs.</em> Phenomenal Consciousness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH5aiii\">Challenging IIT’s Augmentation of Naturalistic Ontology</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH5b\">Aaronson’s <em>Reductio ad Absurdum </em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH5c\">Searle’s Objection</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H6\">References and Further Reading</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"H1\"></a>1. The Main Argument</h2>\n<p>IIT takes certain features of consciousness to be unavoidably true. Rather than beginning with the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) and attempting to explain what about these sustains consciousness, IIT begins with its characterization of experience itself, determines the physical properties necessary for realizing these characteristics, and only then puts forward a theoretical explanation of consciousness, as identical to a special case of information instantiated by those physical properties. “The theory provides a principled account of both the quantity and quality of an individual experience… and a calculus to evaluate whether a physical system is conscious” (Tononi and Koch, 2015).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH1a\"></a>a. Cartesian Commitments</h3>\n<p>IIT takes Descartes very seriously. Descartes located the bedrock of epistemology in the knowledge of our own existence given to us by our thought. “I think, therefore I am” reflects an unavoidable certainty: one cannot deny one’s own existence as a thinker even if one’s particular thoughts are in error. For IIT, the relevance of this insight lies in its application to consciousness. Whatever else one might claim about consciousness, one cannot deny its existence.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH1ai\"></a>i. Axioms</h4>\n<p>IIT takes consciousness as primary. Before speculating on the origins or the necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness, IIT gives a characterization of what consciousness means. The theory advances five axioms intended to capture just this. Each axiom articulates a dimension of experience that IIT regards as self-evident.</p>\n<p>First, following from the fundamental Cartesian insight, is the axiom of existence. Consciousness is real and undeniable; moreover, a subject’s consciousness has this reality intrinsically; it exists from its own perspective.</p>\n<p>Second, consciousness has composition. In other words, each experience has structure. Color and shape, for example, structure visual experience. Such structure allows for various distinctions.</p>\n<p>Third is the axiom of information: the way an experience is distinguishes it from other possible experiences. An experience specifies; it is specific to certain things, distinct from others.</p>\n<p>Fourth, consciousness has the characteristic of integration. The elements of an experience are interdependent. For example, the particular colors and shapes that structure a visual conscious state are experienced together. As we read these words, we experience the font-shape and letter-color inseparably. We do not have isolated experiences of each and then add them together. This integration means that consciousness is irreducible to separate elements. Consciousness is unified.</p>\n<p>Fifth, consciousness has the property of exclusion. Every experience has borders. Precisely because consciousness specifies certain things, it excludes others. Consciousness also flows at a particular speed.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH1aii\"></a>ii. Postulates</h4>\n<p>In isolation, these axioms may seem trivial or overlapping. IIT labels them axioms precisely because it takes them to be obviously true. IIT does not present them in isolation. Rather, they motivate postulates. Sometimes the IIT literature refers to phenomenological axioms and ontological postulates. Each axiom leads to a corresponding postulate identifying a physical property. Any conscious system must possess these properties.</p>\n<p>First, the existence of consciousness implies a system of mechanisms with a particular cause-effect power. IIT regards existence as inextricable from causality: for something to exist, it must be able to make a difference to other things, and vice versa. (What would it even mean for a thing to exist in the absence of any causal power whatsoever?) Because consciousness exists from its own perspective, the implied system of mechanisms must do more than simply have causal power; it must have cause-effect power upon itself.</p>\n<p>Second, the compositional nature of consciousness implies that its system’s mechanistic elements must have the capacity to combine, and that those combinations have cause-effect power.</p>\n<p>Third, because consciousness is informative, it must specify, or distinguish one experience from others. IIT calls the cause-effect powers of any given mechanism within a system its cause-effect repertoire. The cause-effect repertoires of all the system’s mechanistic elements taken together, it calls its cause-effect structure. This structure, at any given point, is in a particular state. In complex structures, the number of possible states is very high. For a structure to instantiate a particular state is for it to specify that state. The specified state is the particular way that the system is making a difference to itself.</p>\n<p>Fourth, consciousness’s integration into a unified whole implies that the system must be irreducible. In other words, its parts must be interdependent. This in turn implies that every mechanistic element must have the capacity to act as a cause on the rest of the system and to be affected by the rest of the system. If a system can be divided into two parts without affecting its cause-effect structure, it fails to satisfy the requirement of this postulate.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the exclusivity of the borders of consciousness implies that the state of a conscious system must be definite. In physical terms, the various simultaneous subgroupings of mechanisms in a system have varying cause-effect structures. Of these, only one will have a maximally irreducible cause-effect structure. This is called the maximally irreducible conceptual structure, or MICS. Others will have smaller cause-effect structures, at least when reduced to non-redundant elements. Precisely this is the conscious state.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH1b\"></a>b. The Identity of Consciousness</h3>\n<p>IIT accepts the Cartesian conviction that consciousness has immediate, self-evident properties, and outlines the implications of these phenomenological axioms for conscious physical systems. This characterization does not exhaustively describe the theoretical ambition of IIT. The ontological postulates concerning physical systems do not merely articulate necessities, or even sufficiencies, for realizing consciousness. The claim is much stronger than this. IIT <em>identifies</em> consciousness with a system’s having the physical features that the postulates describe. Each conscious state is a maximally irreducible conceptual structure, which just is and can only be a system of irreducibly interdependent physical parts whose causal interaction constitutes the integration of information.</p>\n<p>An example may help to clarify the nature of IIT’s explanation of consciousness. Our experience of a cue ball integrates its white color and spherical shape, such that these elements are inseparably fused. The fusion of these elements constitutes the structure of the experience: the experience is composed of them. The nature of the experience informs us about whiteness and spherical shape in a way that distinguishes it from other possible experiences, such as of a blue cube of chalk. This is just a description of the phenomenology of a simple experience (perhaps necessarily awkward, because it articulates the self-evident). Our brain generates the experience through neurons physically communicating with one another in systems linked by cause-effect power. IIT interprets this physical communication as the integration of information, according to the various constraints laid out in the postulates. The neurobiology and phenomenology converge.</p>\n<p>Theories of consciousness need to account for what is sometimes termed the “binding problem.” This concerns the unity of conscious experience. Even a simple experience like viewing a cue ball unites different elements such as color, shape, and size. Any theory of consciousness will need to make sense of how this happens. IIT’s account of the integration of information may be understood as a response to this problem.</p>\n<p>According to IIT, the physical state of any conscious system must converge with phenomenology; otherwise the kind of information generated could not realize the axiomatic properties of consciousness. We can understand this by contrasting two kinds of information. First, there is Shannon information: When a digital camera takes a picture of a cue ball, the photodiodes operate in causal isolation from one another. This process does generate information; specifically, it generates observer-relative information. That is, the camera generates the information of an image of a cue ball for anyone looking at that photograph. The information that is the image of the cue ball is therefore relative to the observer; such information is called Shannon information. Because the elements of the system are causally isolated, the system does not make a difference to itself. Accordingly, although the camera gives information to an observer, it does not generate that information for itself. By contrast, consider what IIT refers to as <em>intrinsic</em> information: Unlike the digital camera’s photodiodes, the brain’s neurons do communicate with one another through physical cause and effect; the brain does not simply generate observer-relative information, it integrates <em>intrinsic</em> information. &nbsp;This information from its own perspective just is the conscious state of the brain. The physical nature of the digital camera does not conform to IIT’s postulates and therefore does not have consciousness; the physical nature of the brain, at least in certain states, does conform to IIT’s postulates, and therefore does have consciousness.</p>\n<p>To identify consciousness with such physical integration of information constitutes an ontological claim. The physical postulates do not describe one way or even the best way to realize the phenomenology of consciousness; the phenomenology of consciousness is one and the same as a system having the properties described by the postulates. It is even too weak to say that such systems give rise to or generate consciousness. Consciousness is fundamental to these systems in the same way as mass or charge is basic to certain particles.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH1bi\"></a>i. Some Predictions</h4>\n<p>IIT’s conception of consciousness as mechanisms systematically integrating information through cause and effect lends itself to quantification. The more complex the MICS, the higher the level of consciousness: the corresponding metric is phi. Sometimes the IIT literature uses the term “prediction” to refer to implications of the theory whose falsifiability is a matter of controversy. This section will focus on more straightforward cases of prediction, where the evidence is consistent with IIT’s claims. These cases provide corroborative evidence that enhance the plausibility of IIT.</p>\n<p>Deep sleep states are less experientially rich than waking ones. IIT predicts, therefore, that such sleep states will have lower phi values than waking states. For this to be true, analysis of the brain during these contrasting states would have to show a disparity in the systematic complexity of non-redundant mechanisms. On IIT, this disparity of MICS complexity directly implies a disparity in the amount of conscious integrated information, because the MICS is identical to the conscious state. The neuroscientific findings bear out this prediction.</p>\n<p>IIT cites similar evidence from the study of patients with brain damage. For example, we already know that among vegetative patients, there are some whose brain scans indicate that they can hear and process language: When researchers prompt such patients to think about playing tennis, the appropriate areas of the brain become activated. Other vegetative patients do not respond this way. Naturally, this suggests that the former have a richer degree of consciousness than the latter. When analyzed according to IIT’s theory, the former have a higher phi metric than the latter; once again, IIT has made a prediction that receives empirical confirmation. IIT also claims that findings in the analysis of patients under anesthesia corroborate its claims.</p>\n<p>In all these cases, one of two things happens. First, as consciousness fades, cortical activity may become less global. This reversion to local cortical activity constitutes a loss of integration: The system no longer is communicating across itself in as complex a way as it had. Second, as consciousness fades, cortical activity may remain global, but become stereotypical, consisting in numerous redundant cause-effect mechanisms, such that the informational achievement of the system is reduced: a loss of information. As information either becomes less integrated or becomes reduced, consciousness fades, which IIT takes as empirical support of its theory of consciousness as integrated information.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH1c\"></a>c. Characterizing the Argument</h3>\n<p>IIT combines Cartesian commitments with claims about engineering that it interprets, in part by citing corroborative neuroscientific evidence, as identifying the nature of consciousness. This borrows from recognizable traditions in the field of consciousness studies, but the structure of the argument is novel. While IIT’s proponents strive for clarity in the exposition of their work by breaking it down into the simpler elements of axioms, propositions, and identity claims, the nature of the relations between these parts remains largely implicit in the IIT literature. To evaluate the explanatory success or failure of IIT, it should prove helpful to attempt an explication of these logical relations. This requires characterizing the relationship of the axioms with the postulates, and of the identity claims with the axioms, postulates, and supporting neuroscientific evidence.</p>\n<p>The axioms, of course, count as premises. These premises seem to lead to the postulates: each postulate flows from a corresponding axiom. At the same time, IIT describes these postulates as unproven assumptions, which seems at odds with their being conclusions drawn from the axioms. Consider the first axiom and its postulate, concerning existence. The axiom states that consciousness exists, and more specifically, exists intrinsically; the postulate holds that this requires a conscious system to have cause-effect power, and more specifically, to have this power over itself. The link involves, in part, the claim that existence implies cause-effect power. This claim that for a thing to exist, it must be able to make a difference, is plausible, but not self-evident. Nor does the axiomatic premise alone deductively imply this postulate. Epiphenomenalists, for example, claim that conscious mental states, although existent and caused, do not cause further events; they do not make a difference. Epiphenomenalists certainly do not go on to identify consciousness with physically causal systems, as IIT does.</p>\n<p>Tononi (2015) adopts the position that the move from the axioms to the postulates is one of inference to the best explanation, or abduction. On this line, while the axioms do not deductively imply the postulates, the postulates have more than mere statistical inductive support. For example, consider the observation that human brains, which on IIT are conscious systems, have cause-effect power over themselves. Minimally, this offers a piece of inductive support for describing conscious systems in general as having such a power. Tononi takes a stronger line, claiming that a system’s property of having cause-effect power over itself most satisfyingly explains its intrinsic existence. So, what makes the brain a system at all, capable of having its own consciousness, is its ability to make a difference to itself. This illustrates the relation of postulates such as the first, concerning cause-effect power, to axioms such as the first axiom, concerning intrinsic existence, by appeal to something like explanatory fit, or satisfactoriness, which is to characterize that relation abductively.</p>\n<p>In any case, IIT moves from the sub-conclusion about the postulates to a further conclusion, the identity claim: consciousness is identical to a system’s having the physical properties laid out by the postulates, which realize the phenomenology described by the axioms. Here again, the abductive interpretation remains an option. On this interpretation, the <em>conjunction</em> of the physical features of the postulates provides the most satisfactory explanation for the identity of consciousness.</p>\n<p>This breakdown of the argument reveals the separability of the two parts. A less ambitious version of IIT might have limited itself to the first part, claiming that the physical features described by the postulates are the actual and/or best ways of realizing consciousness, or more strongly that they are necessary and/or sufficient, without going on to say that consciousness is identical to a system having these properties. The foregoing paragraphs outlined the possible motivation for the identification claim as lying in the abductive interpretation.</p>\n<p>The notion of best explanation is notoriously slippery, but also ubiquitous in science. From an intuitive point of view one might regard the content of the conjunction of the postulates as apt for accounting for the phenomenology, but one might, motivated by theoretical conservatism, stop short of describing this as an identity relation. One clue as to why IIT does not take this tack may lie in IIT’s methodological goal of parsimony, something the literature mentions with some regularity. Perhaps the simplicity of identifying consciousness with a system’s having certain intuitively apt physical properties outweighs the non-conservatism of the claim that consciousness is fundamental to such systems the way mass is fundamental to a particle.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H2\"></a>2. The <em>Phi</em> Metric</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"SH2a\"></a>a. The Main Idea</h3>\n<p>IIT strives, among other things, not just to claim the existence of a scale of complexity of consciousness, but to provide a theoretical approach to the precise quantification of the richness of experience for any conscious system. This requires calculating the maximal amount of integrated information in a system. IIT refers to this as the system’s phi value, which can be expressed numerically, at least in principle.</p>\n<p>Digital photography affords particularly apt illustrations of some of the basic principles involved in quantifying consciousness.</p>\n<p>First, a photodiode exemplifies integrated information in the simplest way possible. A photodiode is a system of two elements, which together render it sensitive to two states only: light and dark. After initial input from the environment, the elements communicate input physically with one another, determining the output. So, the photodiode is a two-element system that integrates information. A photodiode not subsumed in another system of greater phi value is the simplest possible example of consciousness.</p>\n<p>This consciousness, of course, is virtually negligible. The photodiode’s experience of light and dark is not rich in the way that ours is. The level of information of a state depends upon its specifying that state as distinct from others. The repertoire of the photodiodes allows only for the most limited differentiation (“this” vs. “that”), whereas the repertoire of a complex system such as the brain allows for an enormous amount of differentiation. Even our most basic experience of darkness distinguishes it not only from light, but from shapes, colors, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Second, a digital camera’s photodiodes’ causal arrangement neatly exemplifies the distinction between integrated and non-integrated information. Putting to one side that each individual photodiode integrates information as simply as possible, those photodiodes do not take input or give output to one another, so the information does not get integrated across the system. For this reason, the camera’s image is informative to us, but not to itself.</p>\n<p>Each isolated photodiode has integrated information in the most basic way, and would therefore have the lowest possible positive value of phi. The camera’s photodiodes taken as a system do not integrate information and have a phi value of zero.</p>\n<p>IIT attributes consciousness to certain systems, or networks. These can be understood abstractly as models. A computer’s hardware may be modelled by logic circuits, which represent its elements and their connections as interconnected logic gates. The way a particular connection within this network mediates input and output determines what kind of logic gate it is. For example, consider a connection that takes two inputs, either which can be True or False, and then gives one output, True or False. The AND logic gate would give an output of True if both inputs were True or if both inputs were False. In other words, if both the one AND the other have the same value, the AND gate gives a True output. Such modelling captures the dynamics of binary systems, with “True” corresponding to 1 and “False” to 0. The arrangement of a network’s various logic gates (which include not only AND, but also OR, NOT, XOR, among others) determines how any particular input to the system at time-step 1 will result in output at time-step 2, and so on for that system. The brain can be modelled this way too. Input can come from a prior brain state, or from other parts of the nervous system, through the senses. The input causes a change in brain state, depending on the organization of the particular brain, which can be articulated in abstract logic.</p>\n<p>In order to measure the level of consciousness of a system, IIT must describe the amount of its integrated information. This is done by partitioning the system in various ways. If the digital camera’s photodiodes are partitioned, say, by dividing the abstract model of its elements in half, no integrated information is lost, because all the photodiodes are in isolation from each other, and so the division does not break any connections. If no logically possible partition of the system results in a loss of connection, the conclusion is that the system does not make a difference to itself. So, in this case, the system has no phi.</p>\n<p>Systems of interest to IIT will have connections that will be lost by some partitions and not by others. Some partitions will sever from the system elements that are comparatively low in original degree of connectivity to the system, in other words elements whose (de)activation has few causal consequences upon the (de)activation of other elements. A system where all or most elements have this property will have low phi. The lack of strong connectivity may be the result of relative isolation, or locality, an element not linking to many other elements, directly or indirectly. Or it could be from stereotypicality, where the element’s causal connections overlap in a largely redundant way with the causal connection of other elements. A system whose elements are connected more globally and non-redundantly will have higher phi. A partition that not only separates all elements that do not make a difference to the rest of the system for reasons of either isolation or redundancy from those that do make a difference, but also separates those elements whose lower causal connectivity decreases the overall level of integration of the system from those that do not, will thereby have picked out the maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS), which according to IIT is conscious. The degree of that consciousness, its phi, depends upon its elements’ level of causal connectivity. This is determined by how much information integration would be lost by the least costly further partition, or, in other words, how much the cause-effect structure of the system would be reduced by eliminating the least causally effective element within the MICS.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that not every system with phi has consciousness. A sub- or super-system of an MICS may have phi but will not have consciousness.</p>\n<p>If we were to take a non-MICS subsystem of a network, which in isolation still has causal power over itself, articulable as a logic circuit, then that would have phi. Were it indeed in isolation, it would have its own MICS, and its phi would correspond to that system’s degree of consciousness. It is, however, not in isolation, but rather part of a larger system.</p>\n<p>IIT interprets the exclusion axiom—that any conscious system is in one conscious state only, excluding all others—as implying a postulate that holds that, at the level of the physical system, there be no “double counting” of consciousness. So, although a system may have multiple subsystems with phi, only the MICS is conscious, and only the phi value of the MICS (sometimes called phi max) measures conscious degree. The other phi values measure degrees of non-conscious integrated information. So, for example, each of a person’s visual cortices does not enjoy its own consciousness, but parts of each belong to a single MICS, which is the person’s one unitary consciousness.</p>\n<p>If we were to take a supersystem of an MICS, one that includes the MICS and also other associated elements with lower connectivity, we could again assign it a phi value, but this would not measure the local maximum of integrated information. The supersystem integrates information, but not maximally, and its phi is therefore not a measure of consciousness. This is probably best understood by example: a group of people in a discussion integrate information, but the connective degree among them is lower than the degree of connectivity within each individual. The group as such has no consciousness, but each individual person—or, more properly, the MICS of each—does. The individuals’ MICSs are local maxima of integrated information and therefore conscious.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH2b\"></a>b. Some Issues of Application</h3>\n<p>The number of possible partitions of a system, called Bell’s number, grows immensely as the number of elements increases. For example, the tiny nematode, a simple species of worm, has 302 neurons, “and the number of ways that this network can be cut into parts is the hyperastronomical 10 followed by 467 zeros” (Koch, 2012). Calculating phi precisely for much more complex systems such as brains eludes computation pragmatically, although not in principle. In the absence of precise phi computation, IIT employs mathematical “heuristics, shortcuts, and approximations” (ibid.). The IIT literature includes several different mathematical interpretations of phi calculation, each intended to replace the last; it is not yet clear that IIT has a settled account of it. Proponents of IIT hold that the mathematical details will enable the application, but not bear on the merits, of the deeper theoretical claims. At least one serious objection to IIT, however, attempts a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of those deeper claims via analysis of the mathematical implications.</p>\n<p>It is clear that, whatever the mathematical details, the basic principles of phi imply that biological nervous systems such as the brain will be capable of having very high phi, because neurons often have thousands of connections to one another. On the other hand, a typical circuit in a standard CPU only makes a few connections to other circuits, limiting the potential phi value considerably. It is also clear that even simple systems will have at least some phi value, and that, provided they constitute local maxima, will have a corresponding measure of consciousness.</p>\n<p>IIT does not intend phi as a measure of the quality of consciousness, only of its quantity. Two systems may have the same phi value but different MICS organizations. In this case, each would be conscious to the same degree, but the nature of the conscious experience would differ. The phi metric captures one dimension, the amount of integrated information, of a system. IIT does address the quality of consciousness abstractly, although not with phi. A system’s model includes its elements and their connections, whose logic can be graphed as a constellation of (de)activated points with lines between them representing (de)activated connections. This is, precisely, its conceptual structure. Recall that the maximally irreducible conceptual structure, or MICS, is, on IIT, conscious. A graph of the MICS, according to IIT, captures its unique shape in quality space, the shape of that particular conscious state. In other words, this is the abstract form of the quality of the experience, or the experience’s form “seen from the outside.” The perspective “from the inside” is available only to the system itself, whose making differences to itself intrinsically, integrating information in one of many possible forms, just precisely is its experience. The phenomenological nature of the experience, its “qualia,” are evident only from the perspective of the conscious system, but the logical graph of its structure is a complete representation of its qualitative properties.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H3\"></a>3. Situating the Theory</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"SH3a\"></a>a. Some Prehistory</h3>\n<p>IIT made its explicit debut in the literature in 2004, but has roots in earlier work. Giulio Tononi, the theory’s founder and major proponent, worked for many years with Gerald Edelman. Their work rejected the notion that mental events such as consciousness will ever find full explanation by reference to the functioning of a system. Such functionalism, to them, ignores the crucial issue of the physical substrate itself. They especially emphasized the importance of re-entry. To them, only a system composed of feedback loops, where input may also serve as output, can integrate information. Feed-forward systems, then, do not integrate information. Even before the introduction of IIT, Tononi was claiming that integrated information was essential to the creation of a scene in primary consciousness.</p>\n<p>Christof Koch, now a major proponent of IIT, collaborated for a long time with Francis Crick. Much of their earlier work focused on identifying the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), especially in the visual system. While such research advances particular knowledge about the mechanisms of one set of conscious states, Crick and Koch came to see this work as failing to address the deeper problems of explaining consciousness generally. Koch also rejects the idea that identifying the functional dynamics of a system aptly treats what makes that system conscious. He came to regard information theory as the correct approach for explaining consciousness.</p>\n<p>So, the two thinkers who became IIT’s chief advocates arrived at that position after close neuroscientific research with Nobel Laureates who eschewed functional approaches to consciousness, favoring investigation of the relation of physical substrate to information generation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH3b\"></a>b. IIT’s Additional&nbsp;Support</h3>\n<p>As of 2016, Tononi, IIT’s creator, runs the Center for Sleep and Consciousness at the University of Madison-Wisconsin. The Center has more than forty researchers, many of whom work in its IIT Theory Group. Koch, a major supporter of IIT, heads the prestigious Allen Institute for Brain Science. The Institute has links with the White House Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, as well as the European Human Brain Project (HBP). &nbsp;IIT’s body of literature continues to grow, often in the form of publications associated with the Center and the Institute. The public reputation of these organizations, as well as of Tononi and Koch’s earlier work, lends a certain authority or celebrity to IIT. The theory has enjoyed ample attention in mainstream media. Nevertheless, IIT remains a minority position among neuroscientists and philosophers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH3c\"></a>c. IIT as <em>Sui Generis</em></h3>\n<p>IIT does not fit neatly into any other school of thought about consciousness; there are points of connection to and departures from many categories of consciousness theory.</p>\n<p>IIT clearly endorses a Cartesian interpretation of consciousness as immediate; such an association is unusual for a self-described naturalistic or scientific theory of consciousness. Cartesian convictions do inform IIT’s axioms and so motivate its overall methodological approach. To label IIT as a Cartesian theory generally, however, would be misleading. For one thing, like most modern theories of consciousness, it dissociates itself from the idea of a Cartesian theatre, or single point in the brain that is the seat of consciousness. Moreover, it is by no means clear how IIT stands in relation to dualism. Certainly, IIT does not advertise itself as positing a mental substance that is separate from the physical. At the same time, it draws an analogy between its identification of consciousness as a property of certain integrated information systems and physics’ identification of mass or charge as a property of particles. One might interpret such introduction of immediate experience into the naturalistic ontology as having parallels with positing a new kind of mental substance. &nbsp;The literature will occasionally describe IIT as a form of materialism. It is true that IIT theorists do focus on the material substrate of informational systems, but again, one might challenge whether a theory that asserts direct experience as fundamental to substrates with particular architectural features is indeed limiting itself to reference to material in its explanation.</p>\n<p>In describing the features of conscious systems, IIT will make reference to function, but IIT rejects functionalism outright. To IIT theorists, articulating the functional dynamics of a system alone will never do justice to the immediate nature of experience.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH3d\"></a>d. Relation to Panpsychism</h3>\n<p>The IIT literature, not only from Tononi but also from Koch and others, refers with some regularity to panpsychism—broadly put, any metaphysical system that attributes mental properties to basic elements of the world—as sharing important ground with IIT. Panpsychism comes in different forms, and the precise relationship between it and IIT has yet to be established. Both IIT and panpsychism strongly endorse Cartesian commitments concerning the immediate nature of experience. IIT, however, only attributes mental properties to re-entrant architectures, because it claims that only these will integrate information; this is inconsistent with any version of panpsychism that insists upon attributing mental properties to even more basic elements of the structure of existence.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH3di\"></a>i. Relation to David Chalmers</h4>\n<p>Of the various contemporary philosophical accounts of consciousness, IIT intersects perhaps most frequently with the work of David Chalmers. This makes sense, not only given Chalmers’s panpsychist leanings, but also given the express commitment of both to a Cartesian acceptance of the immediacy of experience, and a corresponding rejection of functionalist attempts to explain consciousness.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Chalmers’s discussion of the relation of information to consciousness strongly anticipates IIT. Before the introduction of IIT, Chalmers had already endorsed the view of information as involving specification, or reduction of uncertainty. IIT often echoes this, especially in connection with the third axiom and postulate. Chalmers also characterizes information as making a difference, which relates to IIT’s first postulate especially. These notions of specification and difference-making are familiar from the standard Shannon account of information, but the point is that both Chalmers and IIT choose to understand consciousness partly by reference to these concepts rather than to information <em>about</em> something.</p>\n<p>A major theme in Chalmers’s work involves addressing the problem of the precise nature of the connection between physical systems and consciousness. Before IIT, Chalmers speculated that information seems to be the connection between the two. If this is the case, then phenomenology is the realization of information. Chalmers suggests that information itself may be primitive in the way that mass or charge is. Now, this does not directly align with IIT’s later claims of how consciousness is fundamental to certain informational systems in the same way that mass or charge is fundamental to particles, but the parallels are clear enough. Similarly, Chalmers’s description of a “minimally sufficient neural system” as the neural correlate of consciousness resembles IIT’s discussion of the MICS. Both also use the term “core” in this context. It comes as no surprise that IIT and Chalmers have intersected when we read Chalmers’s earlier claims: “Perhaps, then, the intrinsic nature required to ground the information states is closely related to the intrinsic nature present in phenomenology. Perhaps one is even constitutive of the other” (Chalmers, 1996).</p>\n<p>Still, the relationship between Chalmers’s work and IIT is not one of simple alliance. Despite the apparent similarity of their positions on what is fundamental, there is an important disagreement. Chalmers takes the physical to derive from the informational, and grounds the realization of phenomenal space—the instantiation of conscious experience—not upon causal “differences that make a difference,” but upon the intrinsic qualities of and structural relations among experiences. IIT regards consciousness as being intrinsic to certain causal structures, which might be read as the reverse of Chalmers’s claim. &nbsp;In describing his path to IIT, Koch endorses Chalmers as “a philosophical defender of information theory’s potential for understanding consciousness” while faulting Chalmers’s work for not addressing the internal organization of conscious systems (Koch, 2012). To Koch, treating the architecture is necessary because consciousness does not alter in simple covariance with change in amounts of bits of information. Because IIT addresses the physical organization, it struck Koch as superior.</p>\n<p>There has been some amount of cross-reference between IIT and Chalmers in the literature, although important differences are apparent. For example, Chalmers famously discusses the possibility of a zombie, or operating physical match of a human that does not have experience. On IIT, functional zombies are possible, but not zombies whose nervous connections duplicate our own. In other words, if a machine were built to imitate the behavior of a human perfectly, but whose hardware involved feed-forward circuits, then it would generate possibly no phi, or more likely low, local phi, rather than the high phi of human consciousness. But if we posit that the machine replicates the connections of the human down to the level of the hardware, then it would follow that the system would integrate the same level of phi and would be equally conscious.</p>\n<p>Chalmers (2016) writes that IIT “can be construed as a form of emergent panpsychism,” which is true in a sense, but requires qualification. By “emergent panpsychism” Chalmers means that IIT posits consciousness as fundamental not to the merest elements of existence but to certain structures that emerge at the level of particles’ relations to one another. &nbsp;This is a fair assessment, whether or not IIT’s advocates choose to label the theory this way. But in the difference between emergent and non-emergent lies the substance of IIT: what precisely makes one structure “emerge” conscious and another not is what IIT hopes to explain. Non-emergent panpsychism of the sort associated with Chalmers by definition pitches its explanation at a different level. Indeed, it does not necessarily grant the premise that there exist non-conscious elements, let alone structures, in the first place. Despite the similarities between IIT and some of Chalmers’s work, the two should not be confused.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H4\"></a>4. Implications</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"SH4a\"></a>a. The Spectrum of Consciousness</h3>\n<p>It is widely accepted that humans experience varying degrees of consciousness. In sleep, for example, the richness of experience diminishes, and sometimes we do not experience at all. IIT implies that brain activity during this time will generate either less information or less integrated information, and interprets experimental results as bearing this out. On IIT, the complexity of physical connections in the MICS corresponds to the level of consciousness. By contrast, the cerebellum, which has many neurons, but neurons that are not complexly interconnected and so do not belong to the MICS, does not generate consciousness.</p>\n<p>There does not exist a widely accepted position on non-human consciousness. IIT counts among its merits that the principles it uses to characterize human consciousness can apply to non-human cases.</p>\n<p>On IIT, consciousness happens when a system makes a difference to itself at a physical level: elements causally connected to one another in a re-entrant architecture integrate information, and the subset of these with maximal causal power is conscious. The human brain offers an excellent example of re-entrant architecture integrating information, capable of sustaining highly complex MICSs, but nothing in IIT limits the attribution of consciousness to human brains only.</p>\n<p>Mammalian brains share similarities in neural and synaptic structure: the human case is not obviously exceptional. Other, non-mammalian species demonstrate behavior associated in humans with consciousness. These considerations suggest that humans are not the only species capable of consciousness. IIT makes a point of remaining open to the possibility that many other species may possess at least some degree of consciousness. At the same time, further study of non-human neuroanatomy is required to determine whether and how this in facts holds true. As mentioned above, even the human cerebellum does not have the correct architecture to generate consciousness, and it is possible that other species have neural organizations that facilitate complex behavior without generating high phi. The IIT research program offers a way to establish whether these other systems are more like the cerebellum or the cerebral cortex in humans. Of course, consciousness levels will not correspond completely to species alone. Within conscious species, there will be a range of phi levels, and even within a conscious phenotype, consciousness will not remain constant from infancy to death, wakefulness to sleep, and so forth.</p>\n<p>IIT claims that its principles are consistent with the existence of cases of dual consciousness within split-brain patients. In such instances, on IIT, two local maxima of integrated information exist separately from one another, generating separate consciousness. IIT does not hold that a system need have only one local maximum, although this may be true of normal brains; in split-brain patients, the re-entrant architecture has been severed so as to create two. IIT also takes its identification of MICSs through quantification of phi as a potential tool for assessing other actual or possible cases of multiple consciousness within one brain.</p>\n<p>Such claims also allow IIT to rule out instances of aggregate consciousness. The exclusion principle forbids double-counting of consciousness. A system will have various subsystems with phi value, but only the local maxima of phi within the system can be conscious. A normal waking human brain has only one conscious MICS, and even a split-brain patient’s conscious systems do not overlap but rather are separate. One’s conscious experience is precisely what it is and nothing else. All this implies that, for example, the United States of America has no superordinate consciousness in addition to the consciousness of its individuals. The local maxima of integrated information reside within the skulls of those individuals; the phi value of the connections among them is much lower.</p>\n<p>Although IIT allows for a potentially very wide range of degrees of consciousness and conscious entities, this has its limits. Some versions of panpsychism attribute mental properties to even the most basic elements of the structure of the world, but the simplest conscious entity admitted on IIT to be conscious would have to be a system of at least two elements that have cause-effect power over one another. Otherwise no integrated information exists. Objects such as rocks and grains of sand have no phi, whether in isolation or heaped into an aggregate, and so no consciousness.</p>\n<p>IIT’s criteria for consciousness are consistent with the existence of artificial consciousness. The photodiode, because it integrates information, has a phi value; if not subsumed into a system of higher phi, this will count as local maximum: the simplest possible MICS or conscious system. Many or most instances of phi and consciousness may be the result of evolution in nature, independent of human technology, but this is a contingent fact. Often technological systems involve feed-forward architecture that lowers or possibly eliminates phi, but if the system is physically re-entrant and satisfies the other criteria laid out by IIT, it may be conscious. In fact, according to IIT, we may build artificial systems with a greater degree of consciousness than humans.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH4b\"></a>b. IIT and Physics</h3>\n<p>IIT has garnered some attention in the physics literature. Even if one accepts the basic principles of IIT, it still remains open to offer a different account of the physical particulars. Tononi and the other proponents of IIT coming from neuroscientific backgrounds tend to offer description at a classical grain. They frame integrated information by reference to neurons and synapses in the case of brains, and to re-entrant hardware architecture in the case of artificial systems. Such descriptions stay within the classical physics paradigm. This does not exhaust the theoretical problem space for characterizing integrated information.</p>\n<p>One alternative (Barrett, 2014) proposes that consciousness comes from the integration of information intrinsic to fundamental fields. This account calls for reconceiving the phi metric, which in its 2016 form applies only to discrete systems, and not to electromagnetic fields. &nbsp;Another account (Tegmark, 2015) also proposes non-classical physical description of conscious, integrated information. This generalizes beyond neural or neural-type systems to quantum systems, suggesting that consciousness is a state of matter, whimsically labelled “perceptronium.”</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH4c\"></a>c. Artificial Consciousness</h3>\n<p>IIT’s basic arguments imply, and the IIT literature often explicitly claims, certain important constraints upon artificial conscious systems.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH4ci\"></a>i. Constraints on Structure/Architecture</h4>\n<p>At the level of hardware, computation may process information with either feed-forward or re-entrant architecture. In feed-forward systems, information gets processed in only one direction, taking input and giving output. In re-entrant systems, which consist of feedback loops, signals are not confined to movement in one direction only; output may operate as input also.</p>\n<p>IIT interprets the integration axiom (the fourth axiom, which says that each experience’s phenomenological elements are interdependent) as entailing the fourth postulate, which claims that each mechanism of a conscious system must have the potential to relate causally to the other mechanisms of that system. By definition, in a feed-forward system, mechanisms cannot act as causes upon those parts of the system from which they take input. A purely feed-forward system would have no phi, because although it would process information, it would not integrate that information at the physical level.</p>\n<p>One implication for artificial consciousness is immediately clear: Feed-forward architectures will not be conscious. Even a feed-forward system that perfectly replicated the behavior of a conscious system would only <em>simulate</em> consciousness. Artificial systems would need to have re-entrant structure to generate consciousness.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, re-entrant systems may still generate very low levels of phi. Conventional CPUs have transistors that only communicate with several others. By contrast, each neuron of the conscious network of the brain connects with thousands of others, a far more complex re-entrant structure, making a difference to itself at the physical level in such a way as to generate much higher phi value. For this reason, brains are capable of realizing much richer consciousness than conventional computers. The field of artificial consciousness, therefore, would do well to emulate the neural connectivity of the brain.</p>\n<p>Still another constraint applies, this one associated with the fifth postulate, the postulate of exclusion. A system may have numerous phi-generating subsystems, but according to IIT, only the network of elements with the greatest cause-effect power to integrate information—the maximally irreducible conceptual structure, or MICS—is conscious. Re-entrant systems may have local maxima of phi, and therefore small pockets of consciousness. Those attempting to engineer high degrees of artificial consciousness need to focus their design on creating a large MICS, not simply small, non-overlapping MICSs.</p>\n<p>If IIT is correct in placing such constraints upon artificial consciousness, deep convolutional networks such as GooGleNet and advanced projects like Blue Brain may be unable to realize high levels of consciousness.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH4cii\"></a>ii. Relation to “Silent Neurons”</h4>\n<p>IIT’s third postulate has a somewhat counterintuitive implication. The third axiom claims that each conscious experience is precisely what it is; that is, it is distinct from other experiences. The third postulate claims that, in order to realize this feature of consciousness, a system must have a range of possible states, describable by reference to the cause-effect repertoires of its mechanistic elements. The system realizes a specific conscious state by instantiating one of those particular physical arrangements.</p>\n<p>An essential component of the phenomenology of a conscious state is the degree of specificity: a photodiode that registers light specifies one of only two possible states. IIT accepts that such a simple mechanism, if not subsumed under a larger MICS, must be conscious, but only to a negligible degree. On the other hand, when a human brain registers light, it distinguishes it from countless other states; not only from dark, but from different shades of color, from sound, and so forth. The brain state is correspondingly more <em>informative</em> than the photodiode state.</p>\n<p>This means that not only active neuronal firing, but also neuronal silence, determines the nature of a conscious state. Inactive parts of the complex, as well as active ones, contribute to the specification at the physical level, which IIT takes as the realization of the conscious state.</p>\n<p>It is important not to conflate silent, or inactive, neurons of this kind with de-activated neurons. Only neurons that genuinely fall within the cause-effect repertoires of the mechanistic elements of the system count as contributing to specification, and this applies to inactive as well as to active ones. If a neuron was incapable all along of having causal power within the MICS, its inactivity plays no role in generating phenomenology. Likewise, IIT predicts that should neurons otherwise belonging to cause-effect repertoires of the system be rendered incapable of such causation (for example, by optogenetics), their inactivity would not contribute to phenomenology.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H5\"></a>5. Objections</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"SH5a\"></a>a. The Functionalist Alternative</h3>\n<p>According to functionalism, mental states, including states of consciousness, find explanation by appeal to function. The nature of a certain function may limit the possibilities for its physical instantiation, but the function, and not the material details, is of primary relevance. IIT differs from functionalism on this basic issue: on IIT, the conscious state is identified with the way in which a system embodies the physical features that IIT’s postulates describe.</p>\n<p>Their opposing views concerning constraints upon artificial consciousness nicely illustrate the contrast between functionalism and IIT. For the functionalist, any system that functions identically to, for example, a conscious human, will by definition have consciousness. Whether the artificial system uses re-entrant or feed-forward architecture is a pragmatic matter. It may turn out that re-entrant circuitry more efficiently realizes the function, but even if the system incorporates feed-forward engineering, so long as the function is achieved, the system is conscious. IIT, on the other hand, expressly claims that a system that performed in a way completely identical to a conscious human, but that employed feed-forward architecture, would only simulate, but not realize consciousness. Put simply, such a system would operate as if it were integrating information, but because its networks would not take output as input, would not actually integrate information at the physical level. The difference would not be visible to an observer, but the artificial system would have no conscious experience.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH5ai\"></a>i. Rejecting Cartesian Commitments</h4>\n<p>Those who find functionalism unsatisfactory often take it as an inadequate account of phenomenology: no amount of description of functional dynamics seems to capture, for example, our experience of the whiteness of a cue ball. Indeed, IIT entertains even broader suspicions. Beginning with descriptions of physical systems may never lead to explanations of consciousness. Rather, IIT’s approach begins with what it takes to be the fundamental features of consciousness. These self-evident, Cartesian descriptors of phenomenology then lead to postulates concerning their physical realization; only then does IIT connect experience to the physical.</p>\n<p>This methodological respect for Cartesian intuitions has a clear appeal, and the IIT literature largely takes this move for granted, rather than offering outright justification for it. In previous work with Edelman (2000), Tononi discusses machine-state functionalism, an early form of functionalism that identified a mental state entirely with its internal, “machine” state, describable in functional terms. Noting that Putnam, machine-state functionalism’s first advocate, came to abandon the theory because meanings are not sufficiently fixed by internal states alone, Tononi rejects functionalism generally. More recently, Koch (2012) describes much work in consciousness as “models that describe the mind as a number of functional boxes” where one box is “magically endowed with phenomenal awareness.” Koch confesses to being guilty of this in some of his earlier work. He then points to IIT as an exception.</p>\n<p>Functionalism is not receiving a full or fair hearing in these instances. Machine-state functionalism is a straw man: contemporary versions of functionalism do not commit to an entirely internal explanation meaning, and not all functionalist accounts are subject to the charge of arbitrarily attributing consciousness to one part of a system. The success or failure of functionalism turns on its treatment of the Cartesian intuitions we all have that consciousness is immediate, unitary, and so on. Rather than taking these intuitions as evidence of the unavoidable truth of what IIT describes in its axioms, functionalism offers a subtle alternative. Consciousness indeed seems to us direct and immediate, but functionalists argue that this “seeming” can be adequately accounted for without positing a substantive phenomenality beyond function. Functionalists claim that the seeming immediacy of consciousness receives sufficient explanation as a set of beliefs and dispositions to believe that consciousness is immediate. The challenge lies in giving a functionalist account of such beliefs: no mean feat, but not the deep mystery that non-functionalists construe consciousness as posing. If functionalism is correct in this characterization of consciousness, it undercuts the very premises of IIT.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH5aii\"></a>ii. Case Study: Access <em>vs.</em> Phenomenal Consciousness</h4>\n<p>Function may be understood in terms of access. If a conscious system has cognitive access to an association or belief, then that association or belief is conscious. In humans, access is often taken to be demonstrated by verbal reporting, although other behaviors may indicate cognitive access. Functionalists hold that cognitive access exhaustively describes consciousness (Cohen and Dennett, 2012). Others hold that subjects may be phenomenally conscious of stimuli without cognitively accessing them.</p>\n<p>Interpretation of the relevant empirical studies is a matter of controversy. The phenomenon known as “change blindness” occurs when a subject fails to notice subtle differences between two pictures, even while reporting thoroughly perceiving each. Dennett’s version of functionalism, at least, interprets this as the subject not having cognitive access to the details that have changed, and moreover as not being conscious of them. The subject overestimates the richness of his or her conscious perception. Certain non-functionalists claim that the subject does indeed have the reported rich conscious phenomenology, even though cognitive access to that phenomenal experience is incomplete. Block (2011), for instance, holds this interpretation, claiming that “perceptual consciousness overflows cognitive access.” On this account, phenomenal consciousness may occur even in the absence of access consciousness.</p>\n<p>IIT’s treatment of the role of silent neurons aligns with the non-functionalist interpretation. On IIT, a system’s consciousness grows in complexity and richness as the number of elements that could potentially relate causally within the MICS grows. Such elements, even when inactive, contribute to the specification of the integrated information, and so help to fix the phenomenal nature of the experience. In biological systems, this means that silent but potentially active neurons matter to consciousness.</p>\n<p>Such silent neurons are not accessed by the system. These non-accessed neurons still contribute to consciousness. As in Block’s non-functionalism, access is not necessary for consciousness. On IIT, it is crucial that these neurons could potentially be active, so they must be accessible to the system. Block’s account is consistent with this in that he claims that the non-accessed phenomenal content need not be inaccessible. (Koch, separately from his support of IIT, takes the non-functionalist side of this argument (Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007); so do Fahrenfort and Lamme (2012); for a functionalist response to the latter, see Cohen and Dennett (2011, 2012).)</p>\n<p>Non-functionalist accounts that argue for phenomenal consciousness without access make sense given a rejection of the functionalist claim that phenomenality may be understood as a set of beliefs and associations, rather than a Cartesian, immediate phenomenology beyond such things.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH5aiii\"></a>iii. Challenging IIT’s Augmentation of Naturalistic Ontology</h4>\n<p>Any account of consciousness that maintains that phenomenal experience is immediately first-personal stands in tension with naturalistic ontology, which holds that even experience in principle will receive explanation without appeal to anything beyond objective, or third-personal, physical features. Among theories of consciousness, those versions of panpsychism that attribute mental properties to basic structural elements depart perhaps most obviously from the standard scientific position. Because IIT limits its attribution of consciousness to particular physical systems, rather than to, for example, particles, it constitutes a somewhat more conservative position than panpsychism. Nevertheless, IIT’s claims amount to a radical reconception of the ontology of the physical world.</p>\n<p>IIT’s allegiance to a Cartesian interpretation of experience from the outset lends itself to a non-naturalistic interpretation, although not every step in IIT’s argumentation implies a break from standard scientific ontology. IIT counts among its innovations the elucidation of integrated information, achieved when a system’s parts make a difference intrinsically, to the system itself. This differs from observer-relative, or Shannon, information, but by itself stays within the confines of naturalism: for example, IIT could have argued that integrated information constitutes an efficient functional route to realizing states of awareness.</p>\n<p>Instead, IIT makes the much stronger claim that such integrated information, provided it is locally maximal, is <em>identical</em> to consciousness. The IIT literature is quite explicit on this point, routinely offering analogies to other fundamental physical properties. Consciousness is fundamental to integrated information in the same way as it is fundamental to mass that space-time bends around it. The degree and nature of any given phenomenal feeling follow basically from the particular conceptual structure that is the integrated information of the system. Consciousness is not a brute property of physical structure <em>per se</em>, as it is in some versions of panpsychism, but it is inextricable from physical systems with certain properties, just as mass or charge is inextricable from some particles. So, IIT is proposing an addition to what science admits into its ontology.</p>\n<p>The extraordinary nature of the claim does not necessarily undermine it, but it may be cause for reservation. One line of objection to IIT might claim that this augmentation of naturalistic ontology is non-explanatory, or even <em>ad hoc</em>. We might accept that biological conscious systems possess neurology that physically integrates information in a way that converges with phenomenology (as outlined in the relation of the postulates to the axioms) without taking this as sufficient evidence for an identity relation between integrated information and consciousness. &nbsp;In response, IIT advocates might claim that the theory’s postulates give better ontological ground than functionalism for picking out systems in the first place.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH5b\"></a>b. Aaronson’s <em>Reductio ad Absurdum</em></h3>\n<p>The computer scientist Scott Aaronson (on his blog <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>; see Horgan (2015) for an overview) has compelled IIT to admit a counterintuitive implication. Certain systems, which are computationally simple and seem implausible candidates for consciousness, may have values of phi higher even than those of human brains, and would count as conscious on IIT. Aaronson’s argument is intended as a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>; the IIT response has been to accept its conclusion, but to deny the charge of absurdity. Aaronson’s basic claim involves applying phi calculation. Advocates of IIT have not questioned Aaronson’s mathematics, so the philosophical relevance lies in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>IIT refers to richly complex systems such as human brains or hypothetical artificial systems in order to illustrate high phi value. Aaronson points out that systems that strike us as much simpler and less interesting will sometimes yield a high phi value. The physical realization of an expander graph (his example) could have a higher phi value than a human brain. A graph has points that connect to one another, making the points vertices and the connections edges. This may be thought of as modelling communication between points. Expander graphs are “sparse” – having not very many points – but those points are highly connected, and this connectivity means that the points have strong communication with one another. In short, such graphs have the right properties for generating high phi values. Because it is absurd to accept that a physical model of an expander graph could have a higher degree of consciousness than a human being, the theory that leads to this conclusion, IIT, must be false.</p>\n<p>Tononi (2014) responds directly to this argument, conceding that Aaronson has drawn out the implications of IIT and phi fairly, even ceding further ground: a two-dimensional grid of logic gates, even simpler than an expander graph, would have a high phi value and would, according to IIT, have a high degree of consciousness. Tononi has already argued that a photodiode has minimal consciousness; to him, accepting where Aaronson’s reasoning leads is just another case of the theory producing surprising results. After all, science must be open to theoretical innovation.</p>\n<p>Aaronson’s rejoinder challenges IIT by arguing that it implicitly holds inconsistent views on the role of intuition. In his response to Aaronson’s original claims, Tononi disparages intuitions regarding when a system is conscious: Aaronson should not be as confident as he is that expander graphs are not conscious. Indeed, the open-mindedness here suggested seems in line with the proper scientific attitude. Aaronson employs a thought-experiment to draw out what he takes to be the problem. Imagine that a scientist announces that he has discovered a superior definition of temperature and has constructed a new thermometer that reflects this advance. It so happens that the new thermometer reads ice as being warmer than boiling water. According to Aaronson, even if there is merit to the underlying scientific work, it is a mistake for the scientist to use the terms “temperature” or “heat” in this way, because it violates what we mean by those terms in the first place: “heat” means, partly, what ice has less of than boiling water. So, while IIT’s phi metric may have some merit, it is not in measuring consciousness degree, because “consciousness” means, partly, what humans have and expander graphs and logic gates do not have.</p>\n<p>One might, in defense of IIT, respond by claiming that the cases are not as similar as they seem, that the definition of heat necessitates that ice has less of it than boiling water and that the definition of consciousness does not compel us to draw conclusions about expander graphs’ non-consciousness, strange as that might seem. Aaronson’s argument goes further, however, and it is here that the charge of inconsistency comes into play. Tononi’s answer to Aaronson’s original reductio argument partly relies upon claiming that facts such as that the cerebellum is not conscious are totally well-established and uncontroversial. (IIT predicts this because the wiring of the cerebellum yields a low phi and is not part of the conscious MICS of the brain.) Here, argues Aaronson, Tononi is depending upon intuition, but it is possible that although the cerebellum might not produce our consciousness, it may have one of its own. Aaronson is not arguing for the consciousness of the cerebellum, but rather pointing out an apparent logical contradiction. Tononi rejects Aaronson’s claim that expander graphs are not conscious because it relies on intuition, but here Tononi himself is relying upon intuition. Nor can Tononi here appeal to common sense, because IIT’s acceptance of expander graphs and logic gates as conscious flies in the face of common sense.</p>\n<p>It is possible that IIT might respond to this serious charge by arguing that almost everyone agrees that the brain is conscious, and that IIT has more success than any other theory in accounting for this while preserving many of our other intuitions (that animals, infants, certain patients with brain-damage, and sleeping adults all have dimmer consciousness than adult waking humans, to give several examples). Because this would accept a certain role for intuitions, it would require walking back the gloss on intuition that Tononi has offered in response to Aaronson’s reductio. Moreover, Aaronson’s arguments show that such a defense of the overall intuitive plausibility of IIT will face difficult challenges.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH5c\"></a>c. Searle’s Objection</h3>\n<p>In one of very few published discussions of IIT by a philosopher, John Searle (2013a) has come out against it, criticizing its emphasis on information as a departure from the more promising “biological approach.” His objections may be divided into two parts; Koch and Tononi (2013) have offered a response.</p>\n<p>First, Searle claims that in identifying consciousness with a certain kind of information, it has abandoned causal explanation. Appeal to cause should be the proper route for scientific explanation, and Searle maintains, as he has throughout his career, that solving the mystery of consciousness will depend upon the explication of the causal powers special to the brain that give rise to experience. Information fails aptly to address the problem because it is observer-relative; indeed, it is relative to the conscious observer. A book or computer, to take typical examples of objects associated with information, does not contain information except insofar as it is endowed by the conscious subject. Information is in the eye of the beholder. The notion of information presupposes consciousness, rather than explaining it.</p>\n<p>Second, according to Searle, IIT leads to an absurdity, namely panpsychism, which is sufficient reason to reject it. He interprets IIT as imputing consciousness to all systems with causal relations, and so it follows on IIT that consciousness is “spread over the universe like a thin veneer of jam.” A successful theory of consciousness will have to appreciate that consciousness “comes in units” and give a principled account of how and why this is the case.</p>\n<p>Koch and Tononi’s response (2013) addresses both strands of Searle’s argument. First, they agree that Shannonian information is observer-relative, but point out that integrated information is non-Shannonian. IIT defines integrated information as necessarily existing with respect to itself, which they understand in expressly causal terms, as a system whose parts make a difference to that system. Integrated information systems therefore exist intrinsically, rather than relative to observers. Not only does IIT attend to the observer-relativity point, then, but also does so in a way that, contrary to Searle’s characterization, crucially incorporates causality.</p>\n<p>Second, they deny that IIT implies the kind of panpsychism that Searle rejects as absurd. As they point out, IIT only attributes consciousness to local maxima of integrated information (MICS), and although that implies that some simple systems such as the isolated photodiode have a minimal degree of consciousness, it provides a principle to determine which “units” are conscious, and which are not. As Tononi had already put it, before Searle’s charges: “How close is this position to panpsychism, which holds that everything in the universe has some kind of consciousness? Certainly, the IIT implies that many entities, as long as they include some functional mechanisms that can make choices between alternatives, have some degree of consciousness. Unlike traditional panpsychism, however, the IIT does not attribute consciousness indiscriminately to all things. For example, if there are no interactions, there is no consciousness whatsoever. For the IIT, a camera sensor as such is completely unconscious…” (Tononi, 2008).</p>\n<p>Although Searle offers a rejoinder (2013b) to Tononi and Koch’s response, it largely rehearses the original claims. Regardless of whether IIT is true, Tononi and Koch have given good reason to read it as addressing precisely the concerns that Searle raises. Arguably, then, Searle might have reason to embrace IIT as a theory of consciousness that at least attempts a principled articulation of the special casual powers of the brain, which Searle has regarded for many years as the proper domain for explaining consciousness.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H6\"></a>6.

Information Theory (IIT) offers an explanation for the nature and source of consciousness. Initially proposed by Giulio Tononi in 2004, it claims that consciousness is identical to a certain kind of information, the realization of which requires physical, not merely functional, integration, and which can be measured mathematically according to the <em>phi</em> metric.</p>\n<p>The theory attempts a balance between two different sets of convictions. On the one hand, it strives to preserve the Cartesian intuitions that experience is immediate, direct, and unified. This, according to IIT’s proponents and its methodology, rules out accounts of consciousness such as functionalism that explain experience as a system operating in a certain way, as well as ruling out any eliminativist theories that deny the existence of consciousness. On the other hand, IIT takes neuroscientific descriptions of the brain as a starting point for understanding what must be true of a physical system in order for it to be conscious. (Most of IIT’s developers and main proponents are neuroscientists.) IIT’s methodology involves characterizing the fundamentally subjective nature of consciousness and positing the physical attributes necessary for a system to realize it.</p>\n<p>In short, according to IIT, consciousness requires a grouping of elements within a system that have physical cause-effect power upon one another. This in turn implies that only reentrant architecture consisting of feedback loops, whether neural or computational, will realize consciousness. Such groupings make a difference to themselves, not just to outside observers. This constitutes integrated information. Of the various groupings within a system that possess such causal power, one will do so maximally. This local maximum of integrated information is identical to consciousness.</p>\n<p>IIT claims that these predictions square with observations of the brain’s physical realization of consciousness, and that, where the brain does not instantiate the necessary attributes, it does not generate consciousness. Bolstered by these apparent predictive successes, IIT generalizes its claims beyond human consciousness to animal and artificial consciousness. Because IIT identifies the subjective experience of consciousness with objectively measurable dynamics of a system, the degree of consciousness of a system is measurable in principle; IIT proposes the phi metric to quantify consciousness.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#H1\">The Main Argument</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH1a\">Cartesian Commitments</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH1ai\">Axioms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH1aii\">Postulates</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH1b\">The Identity of Consciousness</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH1bi\">Some Predictions</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH1c\">Characterizing the Argument</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H2\">The <em>Phi</em> Metric</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH2a\">The Main Idea</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH2b\">Some Issues of Application</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H3\">Situating the Theory</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH3a\">Some Prehistory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH3b\">IIT’s Additional&nbsp;Support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH3c\">IIT as <em>Sui Generis</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH3d\">Relation to Panpsychism</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH3di\">Relation to David Chalmers</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H4\">Implications</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH4a\">The Spectrum of Consciousness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH4b\">IIT and Physics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH4c\">Artificial Consciousness</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH4ci\">Constraints on Structure/Architecture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH4cii\">Relation to “Silent Neurons”</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H5\">Objections</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SH5a\">The Functionalist Alternative</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH5ai\">Rejecting Cartesian Commitments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH5aii\">Case Study: Access <em>vs.</em> Phenomenal Consciousness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SSH5aiii\">Challenging IIT’s Augmentation of Naturalistic Ontology</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH5b\">Aaronson’s <em>Reductio ad Absurdum </em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SH5c\">Searle’s Objection</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#H6\">References and Further Reading</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"H1\"></a>1. The Main Argument</h2>\n<p>IIT takes certain features of consciousness to be unavoidably true. Rather than beginning with the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) and attempting to explain what about these sustains consciousness, IIT begins with its characterization of experience itself, determines the physical properties necessary for realizing these characteristics, and only then puts forward a theoretical explanation of consciousness, as identical to a special case of information instantiated by those physical properties. “The theory provides a principled account of both the quantity and quality of an individual experience… and a calculus to evaluate whether a physical system is conscious” (Tononi and Koch, 2015).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH1a\"></a>a. Cartesian Commitments</h3>\n<p>IIT takes Descartes very seriously. Descartes located the bedrock of epistemology in the knowledge of our own existence given to us by our thought. “I think, therefore I am” reflects an unavoidable certainty: one cannot deny one’s own existence as a thinker even if one’s particular thoughts are in error. For IIT, the relevance of this insight lies in its application to consciousness. Whatever else one might claim about consciousness, one cannot deny its existence.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH1ai\"></a>i. Axioms</h4>\n<p>IIT takes consciousness as primary. Before speculating on the origins or the necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness, IIT gives a characterization of what consciousness means. The theory advances five axioms intended to capture just this. Each axiom articulates a dimension of experience that IIT regards as self-evident.</p>\n<p>First, following from the fundamental Cartesian insight, is the axiom of existence. Consciousness is real and undeniable; moreover, a subject’s consciousness has this reality intrinsically; it exists from its own perspective.</p>\n<p>Second, consciousness has composition. In other words, each experience has structure. Color and shape, for example, structure visual experience. Such structure allows for various distinctions.</p>\n<p>Third is the axiom of information: the way an experience is distinguishes it from other possible experiences. An experience specifies; it is specific to certain things, distinct from others.</p>\n<p>Fourth, consciousness has the characteristic of integration. The elements of an experience are interdependent. For example, the particular colors and shapes that structure a visual conscious state are experienced together. As we read these words, we experience the font-shape and letter-color inseparably. We do not have isolated experiences of each and then add them together. This integration means that consciousness is irreducible to separate elements. Consciousness is unified.</p>\n<p>Fifth, consciousness has the property of exclusion. Every experience has borders. Precisely because consciousness specifies certain things, it excludes others. Consciousness also flows at a particular speed.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH1aii\"></a>ii. Postulates</h4>\n<p>In isolation, these axioms may seem trivial or overlapping. IIT labels them axioms precisely because it takes them to be obviously true. IIT does not present them in isolation. Rather, they motivate postulates. Sometimes the IIT literature refers to phenomenological axioms and ontological postulates. Each axiom leads to a corresponding postulate identifying a physical property. Any conscious system must possess these properties.</p>\n<p>First, the existence of consciousness implies a system of mechanisms with a particular cause-effect power. IIT regards existence as inextricable from causality: for something to exist, it must be able to make a difference to other things, and vice versa. (What would it even mean for a thing to exist in the absence of any causal power whatsoever?) Because consciousness exists from its own perspective, the implied system of mechanisms must do more than simply have causal power; it must have cause-effect power upon itself.</p>\n<p>Second, the compositional nature of consciousness implies that its system’s mechanistic elements must have the capacity to combine, and that those combinations have cause-effect power.</p>\n<p>Third, because consciousness is informative, it must specify, or distinguish one experience from others. IIT calls the cause-effect powers of any given mechanism within a system its cause-effect repertoire. The cause-effect repertoires of all the system’s mechanistic elements taken together, it calls its cause-effect structure. This structure, at any given point, is in a particular state. In complex structures, the number of possible states is very high. For a structure to instantiate a particular state is for it to specify that state. The specified state is the particular way that the system is making a difference to itself.</p>\n<p>Fourth, consciousness’s integration into a unified whole implies that the system must be irreducible. In other words, its parts must be interdependent. This in turn implies that every mechanistic element must have the capacity to act as a cause on the rest of the system and to be affected by the rest of the system. If a system can be divided into two parts without affecting its cause-effect structure, it fails to satisfy the requirement of this postulate.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the exclusivity of the borders of consciousness implies that the state of a conscious system must be definite. In physical terms, the various simultaneous subgroupings of mechanisms in a system have varying cause-effect structures. Of these, only one will have a maximally irreducible cause-effect structure. This is called the maximally irreducible conceptual structure, or MICS. Others will have smaller cause-effect structures, at least when reduced to non-redundant elements. Precisely this is the conscious state.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH1b\"></a>b. The Identity of Consciousness</h3>\n<p>IIT accepts the Cartesian conviction that consciousness has immediate, self-evident properties, and outlines the implications of these phenomenological axioms for conscious physical systems. This characterization does not exhaustively describe the theoretical ambition of IIT. The ontological postulates concerning physical systems do not merely articulate necessities, or even sufficiencies, for realizing consciousness. The claim is much stronger than this. IIT <em>identifies</em> consciousness with a system’s having the physical features that the postulates describe. Each conscious state is a maximally irreducible conceptual structure, which just is and can only be a system of irreducibly interdependent physical parts whose causal interaction constitutes the integration of information.</p>\n<p>An example may help to clarify the nature of IIT’s explanation of consciousness. Our experience of a cue ball integrates its white color and spherical shape, such that these elements are inseparably fused. The fusion of these elements constitutes the structure of the experience: the experience is composed of them. The nature of the experience informs us about whiteness and spherical shape in a way that distinguishes it from other possible experiences, such as of a blue cube of chalk. This is just a description of the phenomenology of a simple experience (perhaps necessarily awkward, because it articulates the self-evident). Our brain generates the experience through neurons physically communicating with one another in systems linked by cause-effect power. IIT interprets this physical communication as the integration of information, according to the various constraints laid out in the postulates. The neurobiology and phenomenology converge.</p>\n<p>Theories of consciousness need to account for what is sometimes termed the “binding problem.” This concerns the unity of conscious experience. Even a simple experience like viewing a cue ball unites different elements such as color, shape, and size. Any theory of consciousness will need to make sense of how this happens. IIT’s account of the integration of information may be understood as a response to this problem.</p>\n<p>According to IIT, the physical state of any conscious system must converge with phenomenology; otherwise the kind of information generated could not realize the axiomatic properties of consciousness. We can understand this by contrasting two kinds of information. First, there is Shannon information: When a digital camera takes a picture of a cue ball, the photodiodes operate in causal isolation from one another. This process does generate information; specifically, it generates observer-relative information. That is, the camera generates the information of an image of a cue ball for anyone looking at that photograph. The information that is the image of the cue ball is therefore relative to the observer; such information is called Shannon information. Because the elements of the system are causally isolated, the system does not make a difference to itself. Accordingly, although the camera gives information to an observer, it does not generate that information for itself. By contrast, consider what IIT refers to as <em>intrinsic</em> information: Unlike the digital camera’s photodiodes, the brain’s neurons do communicate with one another through physical cause and effect; the brain does not simply generate observer-relative information, it integrates <em>intrinsic</em> information. &nbsp;This information from its own perspective just is the conscious state of the brain. The physical nature of the digital camera does not conform to IIT’s postulates and therefore does not have consciousness; the physical nature of the brain, at least in certain states, does conform to IIT’s postulates, and therefore does have consciousness.</p>\n<p>To identify consciousness with such physical integration of information constitutes an ontological claim. The physical postulates do not describe one way or even the best way to realize the phenomenology of consciousness; the phenomenology of consciousness is one and the same as a system having the properties described by the postulates. It is even too weak to say that such systems give rise to or generate consciousness. Consciousness is fundamental to these systems in the same way as mass or charge is basic to certain particles.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH1bi\"></a>i. Some Predictions</h4>\n<p>IIT’s conception of consciousness as mechanisms systematically integrating information through cause and effect lends itself to quantification. The more complex the MICS, the higher the level of consciousness: the corresponding metric is phi. Sometimes the IIT literature uses the term “prediction” to refer to implications of the theory whose falsifiability is a matter of controversy. This section will focus on more straightforward cases of prediction, where the evidence is consistent with IIT’s claims. These cases provide corroborative evidence that enhance the plausibility of IIT.</p>\n<p>Deep sleep states are less experientially rich than waking ones. IIT predicts, therefore, that such sleep states will have lower phi values than waking states. For this to be true, analysis of the brain during these contrasting states would have to show a disparity in the systematic complexity of non-redundant mechanisms. On IIT, this disparity of MICS complexity directly implies a disparity in the amount of conscious integrated information, because the MICS is identical to the conscious state. The neuroscientific findings bear out this prediction.</p>\n<p>IIT cites similar evidence from the study of patients with brain damage. For example, we already know that among vegetative patients, there are some whose brain scans indicate that they can hear and process language: When researchers prompt such patients to think about playing tennis, the appropriate areas of the brain become activated. Other vegetative patients do not respond this way. Naturally, this suggests that the former have a richer degree of consciousness than the latter. When analyzed according to IIT’s theory, the former have a higher phi metric than the latter; once again, IIT has made a prediction that receives empirical confirmation. IIT also claims that findings in the analysis of patients under anesthesia corroborate its claims.</p>\n<p>In all these cases, one of two things happens. First, as consciousness fades, cortical activity may become less global. This reversion to local cortical activity constitutes a loss of integration: The system no longer is communicating across itself in as complex a way as it had. Second, as consciousness fades, cortical activity may remain global, but become stereotypical, consisting in numerous redundant cause-effect mechanisms, such that the informational achievement of the system is reduced: a loss of information. As information either becomes less integrated or becomes reduced, consciousness fades, which IIT takes as empirical support of its theory of consciousness as integrated information.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH1c\"></a>c. Characterizing the Argument</h3>\n<p>IIT combines Cartesian commitments with claims about engineering that it interprets, in part by citing corroborative neuroscientific evidence, as identifying the nature of consciousness. This borrows from recognizable traditions in the field of consciousness studies, but the structure of the argument is novel. While IIT’s proponents strive for clarity in the exposition of their work by breaking it down into the simpler elements of axioms, propositions, and identity claims, the nature of the relations between these parts remains largely implicit in the IIT literature. To evaluate the explanatory success or failure of IIT, it should prove helpful to attempt an explication of these logical relations. This requires characterizing the relationship of the axioms with the postulates, and of the identity claims with the axioms, postulates, and supporting neuroscientific evidence.</p>\n<p>The axioms, of course, count as premises. These premises seem to lead to the postulates: each postulate flows from a corresponding axiom. At the same time, IIT describes these postulates as unproven assumptions, which seems at odds with their being conclusions drawn from the axioms. Consider the first axiom and its postulate, concerning existence. The axiom states that consciousness exists, and more specifically, exists intrinsically; the postulate holds that this requires a conscious system to have cause-effect power, and more specifically, to have this power over itself. The link involves, in part, the claim that existence implies cause-effect power. This claim that for a thing to exist, it must be able to make a difference, is plausible, but not self-evident. Nor does the axiomatic premise alone deductively imply this postulate. Epiphenomenalists, for example, claim that conscious mental states, although existent and caused, do not cause further events; they do not make a difference. Epiphenomenalists certainly do not go on to identify consciousness with physically causal systems, as IIT does.</p>\n<p>Tononi (2015) adopts the position that the move from the axioms to the postulates is one of inference to the best explanation, or abduction. On this line, while the axioms do not deductively imply the postulates, the postulates have more than mere statistical inductive support. For example, consider the observation that human brains, which on IIT are conscious systems, have cause-effect power over themselves. Minimally, this offers a piece of inductive support for describing conscious systems in general as having such a power. Tononi takes a stronger line, claiming that a system’s property of having cause-effect power over itself most satisfyingly explains its intrinsic existence. So, what makes the brain a system at all, capable of having its own consciousness, is its ability to make a difference to itself. This illustrates the relation of postulates such as the first, concerning cause-effect power, to axioms such as the first axiom, concerning intrinsic existence, by appeal to something like explanatory fit, or satisfactoriness, which is to characterize that relation abductively.</p>\n<p>In any case, IIT moves from the sub-conclusion about the postulates to a further conclusion, the identity claim: consciousness is identical to a system’s having the physical properties laid out by the postulates, which realize the phenomenology described by the axioms. Here again, the abductive interpretation remains an option. On this interpretation, the <em>conjunction</em> of the physical features of the postulates provides the most satisfactory explanation for the identity of consciousness.</p>\n<p>This breakdown of the argument reveals the separability of the two parts. A less ambitious version of IIT might have limited itself to the first part, claiming that the physical features described by the postulates are the actual and/or best ways of realizing consciousness, or more strongly that they are necessary and/or sufficient, without going on to say that consciousness is identical to a system having these properties. The foregoing paragraphs outlined the possible motivation for the identification claim as lying in the abductive interpretation.</p>\n<p>The notion of best explanation is notoriously slippery, but also ubiquitous in science. From an intuitive point of view one might regard the content of the conjunction of the postulates as apt for accounting for the phenomenology, but one might, motivated by theoretical conservatism, stop short of describing this as an identity relation. One clue as to why IIT does not take this tack may lie in IIT’s methodological goal of parsimony, something the literature mentions with some regularity. Perhaps the simplicity of identifying consciousness with a system’s having certain intuitively apt physical properties outweighs the non-conservatism of the claim that consciousness is fundamental to such systems the way mass is fundamental to a particle.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H2\"></a>2. The <em>Phi</em> Metric</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"SH2a\"></a>a. The Main Idea</h3>\n<p>IIT strives, among other things, not just to claim the existence of a scale of complexity of consciousness, but to provide a theoretical approach to the precise quantification of the richness of experience for any conscious system. This requires calculating the maximal amount of integrated information in a system. IIT refers to this as the system’s phi value, which can be expressed numerically, at least in principle.</p>\n<p>Digital photography affords particularly apt illustrations of some of the basic principles involved in quantifying consciousness.</p>\n<p>First, a photodiode exemplifies integrated information in the simplest way possible. A photodiode is a system of two elements, which together render it sensitive to two states only: light and dark. After initial input from the environment, the elements communicate input physically with one another, determining the output. So, the photodiode is a two-element system that integrates information. A photodiode not subsumed in another system of greater phi value is the simplest possible example of consciousness.</p>\n<p>This consciousness, of course, is virtually negligible. The photodiode’s experience of light and dark is not rich in the way that ours is. The level of information of a state depends upon its specifying that state as distinct from others. The repertoire of the photodiodes allows only for the most limited differentiation (“this” vs. “that”), whereas the repertoire of a complex system such as the brain allows for an enormous amount of differentiation. Even our most basic experience of darkness distinguishes it not only from light, but from shapes, colors, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Second, a digital camera’s photodiodes’ causal arrangement neatly exemplifies the distinction between integrated and non-integrated information. Putting to one side that each individual photodiode integrates information as simply as possible, those photodiodes do not take input or give output to one another, so the information does not get integrated across the system. For this reason, the camera’s image is informative to us, but not to itself.</p>\n<p>Each isolated photodiode has integrated information in the most basic way, and would therefore have the lowest possible positive value of phi. The camera’s photodiodes taken as a system do not integrate information and have a phi value of zero.</p>\n<p>IIT attributes consciousness to certain systems, or networks. These can be understood abstractly as models. A computer’s hardware may be modelled by logic circuits, which represent its elements and their connections as interconnected logic gates. The way a particular connection within this network mediates input and output determines what kind of logic gate it is. For example, consider a connection that takes two inputs, either which can be True or False, and then gives one output, True or False. The AND logic gate would give an output of True if both inputs were True or if both inputs were False. In other words, if both the one AND the other have the same value, the AND gate gives a True output. Such modelling captures the dynamics of binary systems, with “True” corresponding to 1 and “False” to 0. The arrangement of a network’s various logic gates (which include not only AND, but also OR, NOT, XOR, among others) determines how any particular input to the system at time-step 1 will result in output at time-step 2, and so on for that system. The brain can be modelled this way too. Input can come from a prior brain state, or from other parts of the nervous system, through the senses. The input causes a change in brain state, depending on the organization of the particular brain, which can be articulated in abstract logic.</p>\n<p>In order to measure the level of consciousness of a system, IIT must describe the amount of its integrated information. This is done by partitioning the system in various ways. If the digital camera’s photodiodes are partitioned, say, by dividing the abstract model of its elements in half, no integrated information is lost, because all the photodiodes are in isolation from each other, and so the division does not break any connections. If no logically possible partition of the system results in a loss of connection, the conclusion is that the system does not make a difference to itself. So, in this case, the system has no phi.</p>\n<p>Systems of interest to IIT will have connections that will be lost by some partitions and not by others. Some partitions will sever from the system elements that are comparatively low in original degree of connectivity to the system, in other words elements whose (de)activation has few causal consequences upon the (de)activation of other elements. A system where all or most elements have this property will have low phi. The lack of strong connectivity may be the result of relative isolation, or locality, an element not linking to many other elements, directly or indirectly. Or it could be from stereotypicality, where the element’s causal connections overlap in a largely redundant way with the causal connection of other elements. A system whose elements are connected more globally and non-redundantly will have higher phi. A partition that not only separates all elements that do not make a difference to the rest of the system for reasons of either isolation or redundancy from those that do make a difference, but also separates those elements whose lower causal connectivity decreases the overall level of integration of the system from those that do not, will thereby have picked out the maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS), which according to IIT is conscious. The degree of that consciousness, its phi, depends upon its elements’ level of causal connectivity. This is determined by how much information integration would be lost by the least costly further partition, or, in other words, how much the cause-effect structure of the system would be reduced by eliminating the least causally effective element within the MICS.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that not every system with phi has consciousness. A sub- or super-system of an MICS may have phi but will not have consciousness.</p>\n<p>If we were to take a non-MICS subsystem of a network, which in isolation still has causal power over itself, articulable as a logic circuit, then that would have phi. Were it indeed in isolation, it would have its own MICS, and its phi would correspond to that system’s degree of consciousness. It is, however, not in isolation, but rather part of a larger system.</p>\n<p>IIT interprets the exclusion axiom—that any conscious system is in one conscious state only, excluding all others—as implying a postulate that holds that, at the level of the physical system, there be no “double counting” of consciousness. So, although a system may have multiple subsystems with phi, only the MICS is conscious, and only the phi value of the MICS (sometimes called phi max) measures conscious degree. The other phi values measure degrees of non-conscious integrated information. So, for example, each of a person’s visual cortices does not enjoy its own consciousness, but parts of each belong to a single MICS, which is the person’s one unitary consciousness.</p>\n<p>If we were to take a supersystem of an MICS, one that includes the MICS and also other associated elements with lower connectivity, we could again assign it a phi value, but this would not measure the local maximum of integrated information. The supersystem integrates information, but not maximally, and its phi is therefore not a measure of consciousness. This is probably best understood by example: a group of people in a discussion integrate information, but the connective degree among them is lower than the degree of connectivity within each individual. The group as such has no consciousness, but each individual person—or, more properly, the MICS of each—does. The individuals’ MICSs are local maxima of integrated information and therefore conscious.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH2b\"></a>b. Some Issues of Application</h3>\n<p>The number of possible partitions of a system, called Bell’s number, grows immensely as the number of elements increases. For example, the tiny nematode, a simple species of worm, has 302 neurons, “and the number of ways that this network can be cut into parts is the hyperastronomical 10 followed by 467 zeros” (Koch, 2012). Calculating phi precisely for much more complex systems such as brains eludes computation pragmatically, although not in principle. In the absence of precise phi computation, IIT employs mathematical “heuristics, shortcuts, and approximations” (ibid.). The IIT literature includes several different mathematical interpretations of phi calculation, each intended to replace the last; it is not yet clear that IIT has a settled account of it. Proponents of IIT hold that the mathematical details will enable the application, but not bear on the merits, of the deeper theoretical claims. At least one serious objection to IIT, however, attempts a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of those deeper claims via analysis of the mathematical implications.</p>\n<p>It is clear that, whatever the mathematical details, the basic principles of phi imply that biological nervous systems such as the brain will be capable of having very high phi, because neurons often have thousands of connections to one another. On the other hand, a typical circuit in a standard CPU only makes a few connections to other circuits, limiting the potential phi value considerably. It is also clear that even simple systems will have at least some phi value, and that, provided they constitute local maxima, will have a corresponding measure of consciousness.</p>\n<p>IIT does not intend phi as a measure of the quality of consciousness, only of its quantity. Two systems may have the same phi value but different MICS organizations. In this case, each would be conscious to the same degree, but the nature of the conscious experience would differ. The phi metric captures one dimension, the amount of integrated information, of a system. IIT does address the quality of consciousness abstractly, although not with phi. A system’s model includes its elements and their connections, whose logic can be graphed as a constellation of (de)activated points with lines between them representing (de)activated connections. This is, precisely, its conceptual structure. Recall that the maximally irreducible conceptual structure, or MICS, is, on IIT, conscious. A graph of the MICS, according to IIT, captures its unique shape in quality space, the shape of that particular conscious state. In other words, this is the abstract form of the quality of the experience, or the experience’s form “seen from the outside.” The perspective “from the inside” is available only to the system itself, whose making differences to itself intrinsically, integrating information in one of many possible forms, just precisely is its experience. The phenomenological nature of the experience, its “qualia,” are evident only from the perspective of the conscious system, but the logical graph of its structure is a complete representation of its qualitative properties.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H3\"></a>3. Situating the Theory</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"SH3a\"></a>a. Some Prehistory</h3>\n<p>IIT made its explicit debut in the literature in 2004, but has roots in earlier work. Giulio Tononi, the theory’s founder and major proponent, worked for many years with Gerald Edelman. Their work rejected the notion that mental events such as consciousness will ever find full explanation by reference to the functioning of a system. Such functionalism, to them, ignores the crucial issue of the physical substrate itself. They especially emphasized the importance of re-entry. To them, only a system composed of feedback loops, where input may also serve as output, can integrate information. Feed-forward systems, then, do not integrate information. Even before the introduction of IIT, Tononi was claiming that integrated information was essential to the creation of a scene in primary consciousness.</p>\n<p>Christof Koch, now a major proponent of IIT, collaborated for a long time with Francis Crick. Much of their earlier work focused on identifying the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), especially in the visual system. While such research advances particular knowledge about the mechanisms of one set of conscious states, Crick and Koch came to see this work as failing to address the deeper problems of explaining consciousness generally. Koch also rejects the idea that identifying the functional dynamics of a system aptly treats what makes that system conscious. He came to regard information theory as the correct approach for explaining consciousness.</p>\n<p>So, the two thinkers who became IIT’s chief advocates arrived at that position after close neuroscientific research with Nobel Laureates who eschewed functional approaches to consciousness, favoring investigation of the relation of physical substrate to information generation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH3b\"></a>b. IIT’s Additional&nbsp;Support</h3>\n<p>As of 2016, Tononi, IIT’s creator, runs the Center for Sleep and Consciousness at the University of Madison-Wisconsin. The Center has more than forty researchers, many of whom work in its IIT Theory Group. Koch, a major supporter of IIT, heads the prestigious Allen Institute for Brain Science. The Institute has links with the White House Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, as well as the European Human Brain Project (HBP). &nbsp;IIT’s body of literature continues to grow, often in the form of publications associated with the Center and the Institute. The public reputation of these organizations, as well as of Tononi and Koch’s earlier work, lends a certain authority or celebrity to IIT. The theory has enjoyed ample attention in mainstream media. Nevertheless, IIT remains a minority position among neuroscientists and philosophers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH3c\"></a>c. IIT as <em>Sui Generis</em></h3>\n<p>IIT does not fit neatly into any other school of thought about consciousness; there are points of connection to and departures from many categories of consciousness theory.</p>\n<p>IIT clearly endorses a Cartesian interpretation of consciousness as immediate; such an association is unusual for a self-described naturalistic or scientific theory of consciousness. Cartesian convictions do inform IIT’s axioms and so motivate its overall methodological approach. To label IIT as a Cartesian theory generally, however, would be misleading. For one thing, like most modern theories of consciousness, it dissociates itself from the idea of a Cartesian theatre, or single point in the brain that is the seat of consciousness. Moreover, it is by no means clear how IIT stands in relation to dualism. Certainly, IIT does not advertise itself as positing a mental substance that is separate from the physical. At the same time, it draws an analogy between its identification of consciousness as a property of certain integrated information systems and physics’ identification of mass or charge as a property of particles. One might interpret such introduction of immediate experience into the naturalistic ontology as having parallels with positing a new kind of mental substance. &nbsp;The literature will occasionally describe IIT as a form of materialism. It is true that IIT theorists do focus on the material substrate of informational systems, but again, one might challenge whether a theory that asserts direct experience as fundamental to substrates with particular architectural features is indeed limiting itself to reference to material in its explanation.</p>\n<p>In describing the features of conscious systems, IIT will make reference to function, but IIT rejects functionalism outright. To IIT theorists, articulating the functional dynamics of a system alone will never do justice to the immediate nature of experience.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH3d\"></a>d. Relation to Panpsychism</h3>\n<p>The IIT literature, not only from Tononi but also from Koch and others, refers with some regularity to panpsychism—broadly put, any metaphysical system that attributes mental properties to basic elements of the world—as sharing important ground with IIT. Panpsychism comes in different forms, and the precise relationship between it and IIT has yet to be established. Both IIT and panpsychism strongly endorse Cartesian commitments concerning the immediate nature of experience. IIT, however, only attributes mental properties to re-entrant architectures, because it claims that only these will integrate information; this is inconsistent with any version of panpsychism that insists upon attributing mental properties to even more basic elements of the structure of existence.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH3di\"></a>i. Relation to David Chalmers</h4>\n<p>Of the various contemporary philosophical accounts of consciousness, IIT intersects perhaps most frequently with the work of David Chalmers. This makes sense, not only given Chalmers’s panpsychist leanings, but also given the express commitment of both to a Cartesian acceptance of the immediacy of experience, and a corresponding rejection of functionalist attempts to explain consciousness.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Chalmers’s discussion of the relation of information to consciousness strongly anticipates IIT. Before the introduction of IIT, Chalmers had already endorsed the view of information as involving specification, or reduction of uncertainty. IIT often echoes this, especially in connection with the third axiom and postulate. Chalmers also characterizes information as making a difference, which relates to IIT’s first postulate especially. These notions of specification and difference-making are familiar from the standard Shannon account of information, but the point is that both Chalmers and IIT choose to understand consciousness partly by reference to these concepts rather than to information <em>about</em> something.</p>\n<p>A major theme in Chalmers’s work involves addressing the problem of the precise nature of the connection between physical systems and consciousness. Before IIT, Chalmers speculated that information seems to be the connection between the two. If this is the case, then phenomenology is the realization of information. Chalmers suggests that information itself may be primitive in the way that mass or charge is. Now, this does not directly align with IIT’s later claims of how consciousness is fundamental to certain informational systems in the same way that mass or charge is fundamental to particles, but the parallels are clear enough. Similarly, Chalmers’s description of a “minimally sufficient neural system” as the neural correlate of consciousness resembles IIT’s discussion of the MICS. Both also use the term “core” in this context. It comes as no surprise that IIT and Chalmers have intersected when we read Chalmers’s earlier claims: “Perhaps, then, the intrinsic nature required to ground the information states is closely related to the intrinsic nature present in phenomenology. Perhaps one is even constitutive of the other” (Chalmers, 1996).</p>\n<p>Still, the relationship between Chalmers’s work and IIT is not one of simple alliance. Despite the apparent similarity of their positions on what is fundamental, there is an important disagreement. Chalmers takes the physical to derive from the informational, and grounds the realization of phenomenal space—the instantiation of conscious experience—not upon causal “differences that make a difference,” but upon the intrinsic qualities of and structural relations among experiences. IIT regards consciousness as being intrinsic to certain causal structures, which might be read as the reverse of Chalmers’s claim. &nbsp;In describing his path to IIT, Koch endorses Chalmers as “a philosophical defender of information theory’s potential for understanding consciousness” while faulting Chalmers’s work for not addressing the internal organization of conscious systems (Koch, 2012). To Koch, treating the architecture is necessary because consciousness does not alter in simple covariance with change in amounts of bits of information. Because IIT addresses the physical organization, it struck Koch as superior.</p>\n<p>There has been some amount of cross-reference between IIT and Chalmers in the literature, although important differences are apparent. For example, Chalmers famously discusses the possibility of a zombie, or operating physical match of a human that does not have experience. On IIT, functional zombies are possible, but not zombies whose nervous connections duplicate our own. In other words, if a machine were built to imitate the behavior of a human perfectly, but whose hardware involved feed-forward circuits, then it would generate possibly no phi, or more likely low, local phi, rather than the high phi of human consciousness. But if we posit that the machine replicates the connections of the human down to the level of the hardware, then it would follow that the system would integrate the same level of phi and would be equally conscious.</p>\n<p>Chalmers (2016) writes that IIT “can be construed as a form of emergent panpsychism,” which is true in a sense, but requires qualification. By “emergent panpsychism” Chalmers means that IIT posits consciousness as fundamental not to the merest elements of existence but to certain structures that emerge at the level of particles’ relations to one another. &nbsp;This is a fair assessment, whether or not IIT’s advocates choose to label the theory this way. But in the difference between emergent and non-emergent lies the substance of IIT: what precisely makes one structure “emerge” conscious and another not is what IIT hopes to explain. Non-emergent panpsychism of the sort associated with Chalmers by definition pitches its explanation at a different level. Indeed, it does not necessarily grant the premise that there exist non-conscious elements, let alone structures, in the first place. Despite the similarities between IIT and some of Chalmers’s work, the two should not be confused.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H4\"></a>4. Implications</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"SH4a\"></a>a. The Spectrum of Consciousness</h3>\n<p>It is widely accepted that humans experience varying degrees of consciousness. In sleep, for example, the richness of experience diminishes, and sometimes we do not experience at all. IIT implies that brain activity during this time will generate either less information or less integrated information, and interprets experimental results as bearing this out. On IIT, the complexity of physical connections in the MICS corresponds to the level of consciousness. By contrast, the cerebellum, which has many neurons, but neurons that are not complexly interconnected and so do not belong to the MICS, does not generate consciousness.</p>\n<p>There does not exist a widely accepted position on non-human consciousness. IIT counts among its merits that the principles it uses to characterize human consciousness can apply to non-human cases.</p>\n<p>On IIT, consciousness happens when a system makes a difference to itself at a physical level: elements causally connected to one another in a re-entrant architecture integrate information, and the subset of these with maximal causal power is conscious. The human brain offers an excellent example of re-entrant architecture integrating information, capable of sustaining highly complex MICSs, but nothing in IIT limits the attribution of consciousness to human brains only.</p>\n<p>Mammalian brains share similarities in neural and synaptic structure: the human case is not obviously exceptional. Other, non-mammalian species demonstrate behavior associated in humans with consciousness. These considerations suggest that humans are not the only species capable of consciousness. IIT makes a point of remaining open to the possibility that many other species may possess at least some degree of consciousness. At the same time, further study of non-human neuroanatomy is required to determine whether and how this in facts holds true. As mentioned above, even the human cerebellum does not have the correct architecture to generate consciousness, and it is possible that other species have neural organizations that facilitate complex behavior without generating high phi. The IIT research program offers a way to establish whether these other systems are more like the cerebellum or the cerebral cortex in humans. Of course, consciousness levels will not correspond completely to species alone. Within conscious species, there will be a range of phi levels, and even within a conscious phenotype, consciousness will not remain constant from infancy to death, wakefulness to sleep, and so forth.</p>\n<p>IIT claims that its principles are consistent with the existence of cases of dual consciousness within split-brain patients. In such instances, on IIT, two local maxima of integrated information exist separately from one another, generating separate consciousness. IIT does not hold that a system need have only one local maximum, although this may be true of normal brains; in split-brain patients, the re-entrant architecture has been severed so as to create two. IIT also takes its identification of MICSs through quantification of phi as a potential tool for assessing other actual or possible cases of multiple consciousness within one brain.</p>\n<p>Such claims also allow IIT to rule out instances of aggregate consciousness. The exclusion principle forbids double-counting of consciousness. A system will have various subsystems with phi value, but only the local maxima of phi within the system can be conscious. A normal waking human brain has only one conscious MICS, and even a split-brain patient’s conscious systems do not overlap but rather are separate. One’s conscious experience is precisely what it is and nothing else. All this implies that, for example, the United States of America has no superordinate consciousness in addition to the consciousness of its individuals. The local maxima of integrated information reside within the skulls of those individuals; the phi value of the connections among them is much lower.</p>\n<p>Although IIT allows for a potentially very wide range of degrees of consciousness and conscious entities, this has its limits. Some versions of panpsychism attribute mental properties to even the most basic elements of the structure of the world, but the simplest conscious entity admitted on IIT to be conscious would have to be a system of at least two elements that have cause-effect power over one another. Otherwise no integrated information exists. Objects such as rocks and grains of sand have no phi, whether in isolation or heaped into an aggregate, and so no consciousness.</p>\n<p>IIT’s criteria for consciousness are consistent with the existence of artificial consciousness. The photodiode, because it integrates information, has a phi value; if not subsumed into a system of higher phi, this will count as local maximum: the simplest possible MICS or conscious system. Many or most instances of phi and consciousness may be the result of evolution in nature, independent of human technology, but this is a contingent fact. Often technological systems involve feed-forward architecture that lowers or possibly eliminates phi, but if the system is physically re-entrant and satisfies the other criteria laid out by IIT, it may be conscious. In fact, according to IIT, we may build artificial systems with a greater degree of consciousness than humans.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH4b\"></a>b. IIT and Physics</h3>\n<p>IIT has garnered some attention in the physics literature. Even if one accepts the basic principles of IIT, it still remains open to offer a different account of the physical particulars. Tononi and the other proponents of IIT coming from neuroscientific backgrounds tend to offer description at a classical grain. They frame integrated information by reference to neurons and synapses in the case of brains, and to re-entrant hardware architecture in the case of artificial systems. Such descriptions stay within the classical physics paradigm. This does not exhaust the theoretical problem space for characterizing integrated information.</p>\n<p>One alternative (Barrett, 2014) proposes that consciousness comes from the integration of information intrinsic to fundamental fields. This account calls for reconceiving the phi metric, which in its 2016 form applies only to discrete systems, and not to electromagnetic fields. &nbsp;Another account (Tegmark, 2015) also proposes non-classical physical description of conscious, integrated information. This generalizes beyond neural or neural-type systems to quantum systems, suggesting that consciousness is a state of matter, whimsically labelled “perceptronium.”</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH4c\"></a>c. Artificial Consciousness</h3>\n<p>IIT’s basic arguments imply, and the IIT literature often explicitly claims, certain important constraints upon artificial conscious systems.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH4ci\"></a>i. Constraints on Structure/Architecture</h4>\n<p>At the level of hardware, computation may process information with either feed-forward or re-entrant architecture. In feed-forward systems, information gets processed in only one direction, taking input and giving output. In re-entrant systems, which consist of feedback loops, signals are not confined to movement in one direction only; output may operate as input also.</p>\n<p>IIT interprets the integration axiom (the fourth axiom, which says that each experience’s phenomenological elements are interdependent) as entailing the fourth postulate, which claims that each mechanism of a conscious system must have the potential to relate causally to the other mechanisms of that system. By definition, in a feed-forward system, mechanisms cannot act as causes upon those parts of the system from which they take input. A purely feed-forward system would have no phi, because although it would process information, it would not integrate that information at the physical level.</p>\n<p>One implication for artificial consciousness is immediately clear: Feed-forward architectures will not be conscious. Even a feed-forward system that perfectly replicated the behavior of a conscious system would only <em>simulate</em> consciousness. Artificial systems would need to have re-entrant structure to generate consciousness.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, re-entrant systems may still generate very low levels of phi. Conventional CPUs have transistors that only communicate with several others. By contrast, each neuron of the conscious network of the brain connects with thousands of others, a far more complex re-entrant structure, making a difference to itself at the physical level in such a way as to generate much higher phi value. For this reason, brains are capable of realizing much richer consciousness than conventional computers. The field of artificial consciousness, therefore, would do well to emulate the neural connectivity of the brain.</p>\n<p>Still another constraint applies, this one associated with the fifth postulate, the postulate of exclusion. A system may have numerous phi-generating subsystems, but according to IIT, only the network of elements with the greatest cause-effect power to integrate information—the maximally irreducible conceptual structure, or MICS—is conscious. Re-entrant systems may have local maxima of phi, and therefore small pockets of consciousness. Those attempting to engineer high degrees of artificial consciousness need to focus their design on creating a large MICS, not simply small, non-overlapping MICSs.</p>\n<p>If IIT is correct in placing such constraints upon artificial consciousness, deep convolutional networks such as GooGleNet and advanced projects like Blue Brain may be unable to realize high levels of consciousness.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH4cii\"></a>ii. Relation to “Silent Neurons”</h4>\n<p>IIT’s third postulate has a somewhat counterintuitive implication. The third axiom claims that each conscious experience is precisely what it is; that is, it is distinct from other experiences. The third postulate claims that, in order to realize this feature of consciousness, a system must have a range of possible states, describable by reference to the cause-effect repertoires of its mechanistic elements. The system realizes a specific conscious state by instantiating one of those particular physical arrangements.</p>\n<p>An essential component of the phenomenology of a conscious state is the degree of specificity: a photodiode that registers light specifies one of only two possible states. IIT accepts that such a simple mechanism, if not subsumed under a larger MICS, must be conscious, but only to a negligible degree. On the other hand, when a human brain registers light, it distinguishes it from countless other states; not only from dark, but from different shades of color, from sound, and so forth. The brain state is correspondingly more <em>informative</em> than the photodiode state.</p>\n<p>This means that not only active neuronal firing, but also neuronal silence, determines the nature of a conscious state. Inactive parts of the complex, as well as active ones, contribute to the specification at the physical level, which IIT takes as the realization of the conscious state.</p>\n<p>It is important not to conflate silent, or inactive, neurons of this kind with de-activated neurons. Only neurons that genuinely fall within the cause-effect repertoires of the mechanistic elements of the system count as contributing to specification, and this applies to inactive as well as to active ones. If a neuron was incapable all along of having causal power within the MICS, its inactivity plays no role in generating phenomenology. Likewise, IIT predicts that should neurons otherwise belonging to cause-effect repertoires of the system be rendered incapable of such causation (for example, by optogenetics), their inactivity would not contribute to phenomenology.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H5\"></a>5. Objections</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"SH5a\"></a>a. The Functionalist Alternative</h3>\n<p>According to functionalism, mental states, including states of consciousness, find explanation by appeal to function. The nature of a certain function may limit the possibilities for its physical instantiation, but the function, and not the material details, is of primary relevance. IIT differs from functionalism on this basic issue: on IIT, the conscious state is identified with the way in which a system embodies the physical features that IIT’s postulates describe.</p>\n<p>Their opposing views concerning constraints upon artificial consciousness nicely illustrate the contrast between functionalism and IIT. For the functionalist, any system that functions identically to, for example, a conscious human, will by definition have consciousness. Whether the artificial system uses re-entrant or feed-forward architecture is a pragmatic matter. It may turn out that re-entrant circuitry more efficiently realizes the function, but even if the system incorporates feed-forward engineering, so long as the function is achieved, the system is conscious. IIT, on the other hand, expressly claims that a system that performed in a way completely identical to a conscious human, but that employed feed-forward architecture, would only simulate, but not realize consciousness. Put simply, such a system would operate as if it were integrating information, but because its networks would not take output as input, would not actually integrate information at the physical level. The difference would not be visible to an observer, but the artificial system would have no conscious experience.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH5ai\"></a>i. Rejecting Cartesian Commitments</h4>\n<p>Those who find functionalism unsatisfactory often take it as an inadequate account of phenomenology: no amount of description of functional dynamics seems to capture, for example, our experience of the whiteness of a cue ball. Indeed, IIT entertains even broader suspicions. Beginning with descriptions of physical systems may never lead to explanations of consciousness. Rather, IIT’s approach begins with what it takes to be the fundamental features of consciousness. These self-evident, Cartesian descriptors of phenomenology then lead to postulates concerning their physical realization; only then does IIT connect experience to the physical.</p>\n<p>This methodological respect for Cartesian intuitions has a clear appeal, and the IIT literature largely takes this move for granted, rather than offering outright justification for it. In previous work with Edelman (2000), Tononi discusses machine-state functionalism, an early form of functionalism that identified a mental state entirely with its internal, “machine” state, describable in functional terms. Noting that Putnam, machine-state functionalism’s first advocate, came to abandon the theory because meanings are not sufficiently fixed by internal states alone, Tononi rejects functionalism generally. More recently, Koch (2012) describes much work in consciousness as “models that describe the mind as a number of functional boxes” where one box is “magically endowed with phenomenal awareness.” Koch confesses to being guilty of this in some of his earlier work. He then points to IIT as an exception.</p>\n<p>Functionalism is not receiving a full or fair hearing in these instances. Machine-state functionalism is a straw man: contemporary versions of functionalism do not commit to an entirely internal explanation meaning, and not all functionalist accounts are subject to the charge of arbitrarily attributing consciousness to one part of a system. The success or failure of functionalism turns on its treatment of the Cartesian intuitions we all have that consciousness is immediate, unitary, and so on. Rather than taking these intuitions as evidence of the unavoidable truth of what IIT describes in its axioms, functionalism offers a subtle alternative. Consciousness indeed seems to us direct and immediate, but functionalists argue that this “seeming” can be adequately accounted for without positing a substantive phenomenality beyond function. Functionalists claim that the seeming immediacy of consciousness receives sufficient explanation as a set of beliefs and dispositions to believe that consciousness is immediate. The challenge lies in giving a functionalist account of such beliefs: no mean feat, but not the deep mystery that non-functionalists construe consciousness as posing. If functionalism is correct in this characterization of consciousness, it undercuts the very premises of IIT.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH5aii\"></a>ii. Case Study: Access <em>vs.</em> Phenomenal Consciousness</h4>\n<p>Function may be understood in terms of access. If a conscious system has cognitive access to an association or belief, then that association or belief is conscious. In humans, access is often taken to be demonstrated by verbal reporting, although other behaviors may indicate cognitive access. Functionalists hold that cognitive access exhaustively describes consciousness (Cohen and Dennett, 2012). Others hold that subjects may be phenomenally conscious of stimuli without cognitively accessing them.</p>\n<p>Interpretation of the relevant empirical studies is a matter of controversy. The phenomenon known as “change blindness” occurs when a subject fails to notice subtle differences between two pictures, even while reporting thoroughly perceiving each. Dennett’s version of functionalism, at least, interprets this as the subject not having cognitive access to the details that have changed, and moreover as not being conscious of them. The subject overestimates the richness of his or her conscious perception. Certain non-functionalists claim that the subject does indeed have the reported rich conscious phenomenology, even though cognitive access to that phenomenal experience is incomplete. Block (2011), for instance, holds this interpretation, claiming that “perceptual consciousness overflows cognitive access.” On this account, phenomenal consciousness may occur even in the absence of access consciousness.</p>\n<p>IIT’s treatment of the role of silent neurons aligns with the non-functionalist interpretation. On IIT, a system’s consciousness grows in complexity and richness as the number of elements that could potentially relate causally within the MICS grows. Such elements, even when inactive, contribute to the specification of the integrated information, and so help to fix the phenomenal nature of the experience. In biological systems, this means that silent but potentially active neurons matter to consciousness.</p>\n<p>Such silent neurons are not accessed by the system. These non-accessed neurons still contribute to consciousness. As in Block’s non-functionalism, access is not necessary for consciousness. On IIT, it is crucial that these neurons could potentially be active, so they must be accessible to the system. Block’s account is consistent with this in that he claims that the non-accessed phenomenal content need not be inaccessible. (Koch, separately from his support of IIT, takes the non-functionalist side of this argument (Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007); so do Fahrenfort and Lamme (2012); for a functionalist response to the latter, see Cohen and Dennett (2011, 2012).)</p>\n<p>Non-functionalist accounts that argue for phenomenal consciousness without access make sense given a rejection of the functionalist claim that phenomenality may be understood as a set of beliefs and associations, rather than a Cartesian, immediate phenomenology beyond such things.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"SSH5aiii\"></a>iii. Challenging IIT’s Augmentation of Naturalistic Ontology</h4>\n<p>Any account of consciousness that maintains that phenomenal experience is immediately first-personal stands in tension with naturalistic ontology, which holds that even experience in principle will receive explanation without appeal to anything beyond objective, or third-personal, physical features. Among theories of consciousness, those versions of panpsychism that attribute mental properties to basic structural elements depart perhaps most obviously from the standard scientific position. Because IIT limits its attribution of consciousness to particular physical systems, rather than to, for example, particles, it constitutes a somewhat more conservative position than panpsychism. Nevertheless, IIT’s claims amount to a radical reconception of the ontology of the physical world.</p>\n<p>IIT’s allegiance to a Cartesian interpretation of experience from the outset lends itself to a non-naturalistic interpretation, although not every step in IIT’s argumentation implies a break from standard scientific ontology. IIT counts among its innovations the elucidation of integrated information, achieved when a system’s parts make a difference intrinsically, to the system itself. This differs from observer-relative, or Shannon, information, but by itself stays within the confines of naturalism: for example, IIT could have argued that integrated information constitutes an efficient functional route to realizing states of awareness.</p>\n<p>Instead, IIT makes the much stronger claim that such integrated information, provided it is locally maximal, is <em>identical</em> to consciousness. The IIT literature is quite explicit on this point, routinely offering analogies to other fundamental physical properties. Consciousness is fundamental to integrated information in the same way as it is fundamental to mass that space-time bends around it. The degree and nature of any given phenomenal feeling follow basically from the particular conceptual structure that is the integrated information of the system. Consciousness is not a brute property of physical structure <em>per se</em>, as it is in some versions of panpsychism, but it is inextricable from physical systems with certain properties, just as mass or charge is inextricable from some particles. So, IIT is proposing an addition to what science admits into its ontology.</p>\n<p>The extraordinary nature of the claim does not necessarily undermine it, but it may be cause for reservation. One line of objection to IIT might claim that this augmentation of naturalistic ontology is non-explanatory, or even <em>ad hoc</em>. We might accept that biological conscious systems possess neurology that physically integrates information in a way that converges with phenomenology (as outlined in the relation of the postulates to the axioms) without taking this as sufficient evidence for an identity relation between integrated information and consciousness. &nbsp;In response, IIT advocates might claim that the theory’s postulates give better ontological ground than functionalism for picking out systems in the first place.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH5b\"></a>b. Aaronson’s <em>Reductio ad Absurdum</em></h3>\n<p>The computer scientist Scott Aaronson (on his blog <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>; see Horgan (2015) for an overview) has compelled IIT to admit a counterintuitive implication. Certain systems, which are computationally simple and seem implausible candidates for consciousness, may have values of phi higher even than those of human brains, and would count as conscious on IIT. Aaronson’s argument is intended as a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>; the IIT response has been to accept its conclusion, but to deny the charge of absurdity. Aaronson’s basic claim involves applying phi calculation. Advocates of IIT have not questioned Aaronson’s mathematics, so the philosophical relevance lies in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>IIT refers to richly complex systems such as human brains or hypothetical artificial systems in order to illustrate high phi value. Aaronson points out that systems that strike us as much simpler and less interesting will sometimes yield a high phi value. The physical realization of an expander graph (his example) could have a higher phi value than a human brain. A graph has points that connect to one another, making the points vertices and the connections edges. This may be thought of as modelling communication between points. Expander graphs are “sparse” – having not very many points – but those points are highly connected, and this connectivity means that the points have strong communication with one another. In short, such graphs have the right properties for generating high phi values. Because it is absurd to accept that a physical model of an expander graph could have a higher degree of consciousness than a human being, the theory that leads to this conclusion, IIT, must be false.</p>\n<p>Tononi (2014) responds directly to this argument, conceding that Aaronson has drawn out the implications of IIT and phi fairly, even ceding further ground: a two-dimensional grid of logic gates, even simpler than an expander graph, would have a high phi value and would, according to IIT, have a high degree of consciousness. Tononi has already argued that a photodiode has minimal consciousness; to him, accepting where Aaronson’s reasoning leads is just another case of the theory producing surprising results. After all, science must be open to theoretical innovation.</p>\n<p>Aaronson’s rejoinder challenges IIT by arguing that it implicitly holds inconsistent views on the role of intuition. In his response to Aaronson’s original claims, Tononi disparages intuitions regarding when a system is conscious: Aaronson should not be as confident as he is that expander graphs are not conscious. Indeed, the open-mindedness here suggested seems in line with the proper scientific attitude. Aaronson employs a thought-experiment to draw out what he takes to be the problem. Imagine that a scientist announces that he has discovered a superior definition of temperature and has constructed a new thermometer that reflects this advance. It so happens that the new thermometer reads ice as being warmer than boiling water. According to Aaronson, even if there is merit to the underlying scientific work, it is a mistake for the scientist to use the terms “temperature” or “heat” in this way, because it violates what we mean by those terms in the first place: “heat” means, partly, what ice has less of than boiling water. So, while IIT’s phi metric may have some merit, it is not in measuring consciousness degree, because “consciousness” means, partly, what humans have and expander graphs and logic gates do not have.</p>\n<p>One might, in defense of IIT, respond by claiming that the cases are not as similar as they seem, that the definition of heat necessitates that ice has less of it than boiling water and that the definition of consciousness does not compel us to draw conclusions about expander graphs’ non-consciousness, strange as that might seem. Aaronson’s argument goes further, however, and it is here that the charge of inconsistency comes into play. Tononi’s answer to Aaronson’s original reductio argument partly relies upon claiming that facts such as that the cerebellum is not conscious are totally well-established and uncontroversial. (IIT predicts this because the wiring of the cerebellum yields a low phi and is not part of the conscious MICS of the brain.) Here, argues Aaronson, Tononi is depending upon intuition, but it is possible that although the cerebellum might not produce our consciousness, it may have one of its own. Aaronson is not arguing for the consciousness of the cerebellum, but rather pointing out an apparent logical contradiction. Tononi rejects Aaronson’s claim that expander graphs are not conscious because it relies on intuition, but here Tononi himself is relying upon intuition. Nor can Tononi here appeal to common sense, because IIT’s acceptance of expander graphs and logic gates as conscious flies in the face of common sense.</p>\n<p>It is possible that IIT might respond to this serious charge by arguing that almost everyone agrees that the brain is conscious, and that IIT has more success than any other theory in accounting for this while preserving many of our other intuitions (that animals, infants, certain patients with brain-damage, and sleeping adults all have dimmer consciousness than adult waking humans, to give several examples). Because this would accept a certain role for intuitions, it would require walking back the gloss on intuition that Tononi has offered in response to Aaronson’s reductio. Moreover, Aaronson’s arguments show that such a defense of the overall intuitive plausibility of IIT will face difficult challenges.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"SH5c\"></a>c. Searle’s Objection</h3>\n<p>In one of very few published discussions of IIT by a philosopher, John Searle (2013a) has come out against it, criticizing its emphasis on information as a departure from the more promising “biological approach.” His objections may be divided into two parts; Koch and Tononi (2013) have offered a response.</p>\n<p>First, Searle claims that in identifying consciousness with a certain kind of information, it has abandoned causal explanation. Appeal to cause should be the proper route for scientific explanation, and Searle maintains, as he has throughout his career, that solving the mystery of consciousness will depend upon the explication of the causal powers special to the brain that give rise to experience. Information fails aptly to address the problem because it is observer-relative; indeed, it is relative to the conscious observer. A book or computer, to take typical examples of objects associated with information, does not contain information except insofar as it is endowed by the conscious subject. Information is in the eye of the beholder. The notion of information presupposes consciousness, rather than explaining it.</p>\n<p>Second, according to Searle, IIT leads to an absurdity, namely panpsychism, which is sufficient reason to reject it. He interprets IIT as imputing consciousness to all systems with causal relations, and so it follows on IIT that consciousness is “spread over the universe like a thin veneer of jam.” A successful theory of consciousness will have to appreciate that consciousness “comes in units” and give a principled account of how and why this is the case.</p>\n<p>Koch and Tononi’s response (2013) addresses both strands of Searle’s argument. First, they agree that Shannonian information is observer-relative, but point out that integrated information is non-Shannonian. IIT defines integrated information as necessarily existing with respect to itself, which they understand in expressly causal terms, as a system whose parts make a difference to that system. Integrated information systems therefore exist intrinsically, rather than relative to observers. Not only does IIT attend to the observer-relativity point, then, but also does so in a way that, contrary to Searle’s characterization, crucially incorporates causality.</p>\n<p>Second, they deny that IIT implies the kind of panpsychism that Searle rejects as absurd. As they point out, IIT only attributes consciousness to local maxima of integrated information (MICS), and although that implies that some simple systems such as the isolated photodiode have a minimal degree of consciousness, it provides a principle to determine which “units” are conscious, and which are not. As Tononi had already put it, before Searle’s charges: “How close is this position to panpsychism, which holds that everything in the universe has some kind of consciousness? Certainly, the IIT implies that many entities, as long as they include some functional mechanisms that can make choices between alternatives, have some degree of consciousness. Unlike traditional panpsychism, however, the IIT does not attribute consciousness indiscriminately to all things. For example, if there are no interactions, there is no consciousness whatsoever. For the IIT, a camera sensor as such is completely unconscious…” (Tononi, 2008).</p>\n<p>Although Searle offers a rejoinder (2013b) to Tononi and Koch’s response, it largely rehearses the original claims. Regardless of whether IIT is true, Tononi and Koch have given good reason to read it as addressing precisely the concerns that Searle raises. Arguably, then, Searle might have reason to embrace IIT as a theory of consciousness that at least attempts a principled articulation of the special casual powers of the brain, which Searle has regarded for many years as the proper domain for explaining consciousness.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"H6\"></a>6.

Jared has made here <a href=\"https://awarm.space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on his homepage</a> with categories for “fast” and “slow” posts.</p>\n<p>It’s reminiscent of the system 1 (fast) and system2 (slow) ideas behind Kahneman and Tversky’s work in behavioral economics. (See <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WHuyNX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>)</p>\n<p>It’s also interesting in light of this tweet which came up recently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I very much miss the back and forth with blog posts responding to blog posts, a slow moving argument where we had time to think.</p>\n<p>— Rachel Andrew (@rachelandrew) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelandrew/status/900021982053400577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 22, 2017</a>\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Because the Tweet was shared out of context several years later, someone (accidentally?) replied to it as if it were contemporaneous. When called out for not watching the date of the post, their reply was “you do slow web your way…”<a href=\"https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2021-07-30/1627661729366200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>#</sup></a></p>\n<p>This gets one thinking. Perhaps it would help more people’s contextual thinking if more sites specifically labeled their posts as fast and slow (or gave a 1-10 rating)? Sometimes the length of a response is an indicator of the thought put into it, thought not always as there’s also the oft-quoted aphorism: <a href=\"https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2021-07-30/1627661729366200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“If I Had More Time, I Would Have Written a Shorter Letter”</a>.</p>\n<p>The ease of use of the UI on Twitter seems to broadly make it a platform for “fast” posting which can too often cause ruffled feathers, sour feelings, anger, and poor communication.</p>\n<p>What if there were posting UIs (or micropub clients) that would hold onto your responses for a few hours, days, or even a week and then remind you about them after that time had past to see if they were still worth posting? This is a feature based on Abraham Lincoln’s idea of a “hot letter” or angry letter, which he advised people to write often, but never send.</p>\n<p>Where is the social media service for hot posts that save all your vituperation, but don’t show them to anyone? Or which maybe posts them anonymously?</p>\n<p>The opposite of some of this are the partially baked or even fully thought out posts that one hears about anecdotally, but which the authors say they felt weren’t finish and thus didn’t publish them. Wouldn’t it be better to hit publish on these than those nasty quick replies? How can we create better UI to solve for this?</p>\n<p>I saw a sitcom a few years ago where a girl admonished her friend (an oblivious boy) for liking really old Instagram posts of a girl he was interested in. She said that deep-liking old photos was an obvious and overt sign of flirting.</p>\n<p>If this is the case then there’s obviously a social standard of sorts for this, so why not hold your tongue in the meanwhile, and come up with something more thought out to send your digital love to someone instead of providing a (knee-)jerk reaction?</p>\n<p>Of course now I can’t help but think of the annotations I’ve been making in my copy of Lucretius’ <em>On the Nature of Things</em>. Do you suppose that Lucretius knows I’m in love?</p></div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t\n<div>\n\t\n\t<p><img alt=\"\"
