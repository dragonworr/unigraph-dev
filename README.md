# unigraph-dev

## Getting started

* Recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node.js versions.
  * On MacOS, can do `brew install nvm`, though maintainers [recommend against this](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), favoring bash install
  * Not required, but makes Node upgrades easier

* Using [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) for package management
  * `brew install yarn` or see [Yarn installation docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

* Install dependencies:
  ```
  yarn
  ```

* Build project
  ```
  yarn tsc
  ```
