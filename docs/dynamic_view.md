# Dynamic View

One interesting feature of Unigraph is the ability to create 'dynamic views' - i.e. data-driven views that will be automatically reasoned and displayed in the frontend.

This is currently very much a work in progress, and please make sure to read the documentation below.

# Current Implementation

Currently we only support internal dynamic views: views that are defined and viewed internally. This includes code, todo items, web bookmarks, calendar items, notes, and more.

Supporting user-generated content is our top priority, and we will implement ability to use custom views in the near future.
